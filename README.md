### FAQ

## Why is this so computationally intensive?

I tried to a make this project a balance of both quantity and reliability.  The effeciency was not really taken into account, and it was much faster from a development standpoint to do everything in Selenium vs. finding the API endpoints that each career page uses.

As a result, this script takes a relatively long time to run, but I would much rather have 100 companies that take a long time to scan rather than 10 companies that can be scanned in a shorter period of time.
