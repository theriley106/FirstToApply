The Assessment was two part:\n\nPart 1 consisted of a part A and a part B, and the only languages you can do them in are: Java, C, and C++. No Python, unfortunately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart A was the usual 7 debugging questions that you have about 20 minutes to do. I teach part time so these were really not so bad, mostly 1 line fixes. I would recommend spending a good amount of time understanding what the program should do before you start changing things since Compiling actually takes quite a bit (like 8 seconds) which is probably intentional to make it harder. Don't worry if you get a bad score since I heard that people who got 4/7 and 5/7 have still been given final interviews.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart B was 24 logical questions that you are to complete in 30 minutes. These also aren't that bad, but the one catch is you **cannot go back to previous questions**. So you should really try your best to do the question on your first go, and if it's taking too much time just guess (it's multiple choice) and move on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart 2 was a coding challenge consisting of 2 questions (I'm not going to say what the questions are about, but I will say that if you know your data structures and algorithms that's great, but **make sure you know how to code them**). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question for you all is this: I got 7/7 on the Debugging portion (it tells you your score), probably -3 or -4 on the Logical questions (they don't tell you your score so I'm estimating), and I got the first question fully correct on Part 2, but my second question didn't compile. I knew exactly which algorithm to use and so I designed helper methods to modularize my work, but the helper methods would not compile (all my brackets were correct and on [repl.it](https://repl.it) it compiled fine). So I guess you can't use helper methods and I wasted almost all my time on those methods that wouldn't work so I was donezo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom people who've done the Amazon SDE challenge in the past and have gotten to the final round of interview; do you think my score results are good enough to move on?",

The numbers they use in the questions are pretty mixed, some have decimals, some are whole numbers, but I found that usually the numbers weren't that large, generally less than 100. The second part I found to be a lot more difficult. Basically they give you a sequence of letters and/or numbers and you have to find the pattern. I'm having a hard time finding examples but there generally were some patterns you could follow to figure out the answers.\n\nTo practice the first part, you could use this site http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/ which seems to be pretty good. The website http://www.tradertest.org used to have some really useful practice tests on it but it seems to be having issues and the tests as of writing no longer are on there.
