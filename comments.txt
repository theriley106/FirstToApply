I'd say this was a pretty good season.

* Microsoft -> Return Offer ($7750/mo) -> Turned Down
* Google -> Return Offer  ($7500/mo) -> **Accepted!**
* Bloomberg -> Onsite -> Offer  ($50/hr) -> **Accepted!**
* Stripe -> Phone Interview -> Onsite -> Offer ($8000/mo)
* Jane Street -> Rejected
* Airbnb -> Rejected
* Amazon -> Rejected
* Twitter -> Coding Challenge -> No Response
* Two Sigma -> Coding Challenge -> Rejected
* *NYC Startup* -> Coding Challenge -> Phone Interview -> *I said I didn't want to continue*

Thankfully the Google and Bloomberg internships didn't overlap so I was able to accept both of them! If anyone has any questions about any of the interview processes or my experiences at Google or Microsoft, I'll be happy to answer them.

EDIT: received an offer from Stripe.

I’ve accepted an offer to work as a Business analytics intern for a large financial company.

Just wanna remind everyone that CS degrees can be applied to so many areas and many companies would kill to hire CS majors in roles that don’t require coding. I think studying CS has given me an opportunity to learn about something I love, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you need to do SDE for a living! 

I encourage you all to look into analyst roles or PM roles on the tech side of things if you’re not dead set on SWE. CS degrees are completely applicable and even helpful in many other career paths. 

What a season this has been!

What's up guys? Let's share what's happening! I literally applied to every company that is worth to do.

For me,

1. Scheduled interviews: Google, AppLovin, LendingHome.
2. Need to do coding challenges: Wove, Poshmark
3. Did coding challenge(or automated interview) but didnt get anything back yet: Attlassian, Visa, Twitter, Paleton, Verizon
4. rejected after coding challenge: Two Sigma, Stripe
5. rejected on resume: Reddit, Facebook, Palantir, RiotGames, Quora, Box
Got an offer from Doordash! 

Doordash is one of my first choices and I am so happy now :)
Anyone else get that email from Twitch talking about how they filled half the projects so far and that they are still looking for people?
I got an interview for Reddit and it was a 30 minute behavioral type of interview and I thought it went great but today, 4 days later, I get rejected.  
  

Was at least hoping to make it to the coding portion of the interview process to prove my skills but nope :/
  

I go to a California state school and 1 internship at local company and 1 active web dev student position.  
  

So far 100+ applications submitted and only thing I have going for me right now is a video interview for Verizon and 2 coding challenges I need to complete.     


Anybody else feel defeated and tired of trying to get a summer internship yet? Been doing so since the first day of September and I’m so tired of being ghosted and rejected.   
Current junior, was at FB last year. Here's my current status:

&#x200B;

Facebook -> **Return Offer**

Microsoft -> On Campus Interview -> Onsite -> **Offer**

Optiver -> Coding Challenge -> Phone Interview -> Onsite -> **Offer**

Quora -> On Campus Interview -> Onsite -> **Offer**

Flexport -> On Campus Interview -> Phone Interview -> **Offer**

Uber -> On Campus Interview -> Pending Phone Interview

Stripe -> Coding Challenge -> Phone Interview -> Pending Onsite

Lyft -> Pending Phone Interview

Citadel -> Coding Challenge -> Phone Interview -> ***Rejected***

2Sigma, Cloudflare, Affirm -> Coding Challenge -> Waiting

Slack, Square, Databricks, Blend, Airbnb, Box, Dropbox, Rubrik -> No Response

&#x200B;

Not sure what to take at this point - largely debating between Quora and Flexport out of my current offers.
Heyy it's that time of the year when Twitter send rejections to all of their applicants
Anyone ever go full retard and fail the Twilio hackerrank? Bc that just happened to me
Recruiting season finally over for me, hope this is helpful for some of you.

Junior, Top 10 non-CS, 1 prior internship (SWE @ large non-tech company). Switched to CS in sophomore year.

* Apple: Career fair -> 2 x phone screen (1 tech, 1 behavioural) -> offer (accepted)

Note: Career fair was in September, didn't get initial email until almost November so this was completely off my radar until very recently. Apple does by team so a manager has to want to interview you before the process begins.

* Adobe: Applied online -> phone screen -> onsite 
* Facebook: Career fair -> on-campus -> rejected 
* Google: Applied online -> coding challenge -> ghosted 
* Microsoft: Applied online -> on campus interview -> onsite invitation (no spots) 
* Morgan Stanley: Career fair -> onsite-> offer 
* Unity: Career fair -> rejected :(

Coding challenges I got but never did: Airbnb, Coinbase, Goldman Sachs, Palantir

Good luck to everybody still on the search, feel free to PM with questions regarding any of the above!
Someone save me from all this waiting. I don't get why selecting someone for a 3-month internship takes 1 month+. Every company thinks they're so prestigious they need the best of the best for a window of time that hardly matters to them in the long run.
Anyone else ghosted by Microsoft? I applied back in September and my application status still says new lol
Wanted to share my stats for this past recruiting season.

&#x200B;

|Applications sent|102|
|:-|:-|
|Rejected without interview|25|
|Interviews/Coding challenges|18|
|Declined interview (already had offer)|4|
|Ghosted|55|
|Offers|4|

&#x200B;

Edit: I accepted an internship offer from Amazon
Internship update: 300 applications.

It's been hard. I haven't had a life since jan. I wake up, drink coffee, study, and grind.

Out of the last 100 I scored 5 interviews. 

Do not give up bros, we're all gonna make it. 
Hi I'm just curious -- does anybody know what Google's intern compensation looks like this year?
[deleted]
I just got my official start date for my summer internship today. I’m pretty thrilled. It’s not some huge name company but if you’re familiar with the health care industry you’ve probably heard of it. This is only my sophomore summer, so I’m hoping I can leverage this experience to an even better internship the summer of 2020. 
Thought I'd share my interview experience from this season for 2019 internships (junior non-cs major hence a lot of time to interview/prep. 1500+ hours spent on interview prep in 2018 alone (started exactly Jan 1, 2018 - new year new me legit)) also never referred all were online apps. Threw in a bunch of keywords and tech on resume to get hits on keyword search just looked at job postings and noted the tech stacks. happen to go to a target CS school. 2 prior ml swe internships non fang but big name. 600 leetcode. the free top 100 is enough for amazon and apple emphasis on maps and strings. 400+ for google emphasis on graph and hard followups like alternate solution, complexity for different solution etc

rejects are mostly on behavioral / system design / non lc questions/bad interviewer. smaller companies are much pickier (less candidates, smaller teams with more focus on certain areas) and I have less experience and knowledge as noncs. also i have no github/portfolio/hackathons/open source. All of my offers are from big companies who focus mostly on LC as reflected in the results, they hire a lot (1000+ as opposed to 10 (google compared to thumbtack))and the process and questions are a lot easier. they tend not to fly out interns for onsites with system design and a bunch of rounds (excluding msoft)

20% offer rate out of all applications up from 5%  last year then again I applied to < 40 this year and >90 last year. was hardly in class at all last semester btw, well worth the experience for interviews though. also i would;ve switched to cs but im a junior now and i already taught myself ds+algo and got a big n intern so theres no point in wasting 3 more years lmao experience speaks more than a piece of paper see ya around in SF my dudes

Fuck. Only got 3/7 on OA1 debugging. I completely overthought it and spent way too much time on the first two. Pretty sure I aced the logical part too.

RIP
Is Amazon just accepting a ton of interns this year? I just got an offer from them but I thought I completely bombed the interview.  I wasn't even able to answer a really simple question
I'll share my results like /u/Alcentix and /u/Ygtwaytrce have:


-	LinkedIn -> offer (accepted)

-	Capital One -> offer 

-	JPMorgan -> offer

-	Goldman Sachs -> superday (I cancelled)

-	Barclays -> final round (I cancelled)

-	Morgan Stanley -> final round (I cancelled)

-	Citrix -> final round (cancelled)

-	Flatiron Health -> rejected after technical interview

-	DRW -> rejected after second round phone interview

-	Bloomberg -> scheduled first round phone interview then cancelled

Also caught rejections after Hackerrank/codility challenges from a bunch of places: Belvedere, Optiver, Akuna Capital, IMC, HRT, Peloton (absurdly hard)

Rejected at resume stage by a bunch of places: Wolverine Trading, Reddit, Box, Honey, Illumio, Chick-fil-a :/

Got Google Snapshot and Palantir coding challenge, but didn't do them.

No response from a shitload of other places, including Microsoft, Amazon, B of A.

Best of luck to everyone here!
Fortunate to have internship offers from Stripe, Slack and Facebook. Does anyone have advice for picking between these options? Thank you!
I'm finally done - here's my progress! If anyone has questions about the interview process, feel free to ask me anything:

&#x200B;

Google -> Snapshot -> Two interviews -> Host matching -> Offer

Facebook -> Two interviews -> Offer

Pinterest -> Lytmus -> Two interviews -> Offer

Bloomberg -> Phone interview -> Onsite -> Offer

Flatiron Health -> Codility -> Two Interviews -> Offer

Microsoft -> On-campus interview -> Cancelled onsite

MongoDB -> Phone interview -> Cancelled final interview

Dropbox -> HackerRank -> Phone Interview -> Onsite -> Rejected

Stripe -> HackerRank -> Phone Interview -> Onsite -> Rejected

&#x200B;

Also if any former Facebook interns have thoughts about choosing between Menlo Park and Seattle, can I DM you? Thank you!
Got an email from Lyft. I guess they are sending it to everyone?
Nearly wrapped up my recruiting season, but I'm done with all my interviews so I thought I'd share. I'm currently an undergrad junior, with 2 internships in the past. Here are my companies, feel free to msg me if you want.

1. AirBNB (accepted for summer) - 2 technicals, 1 behavioral
2. Amazon (return offer)
3. Bloomberg - 2 technicals, 2 behavioral
4. Microsoft - 1 on campus, 4 on site [2 technical, 1 design, 1 behavioral/design]
5. Facebook (accepted for fall)- 2 technicals. 

With a big 4 company under my belt, I chose AirBNB over FB/MSFT due to the better culture and unicorn status. I'm still awaiting those two's final round feedback, but I would have chosen AirBNB regardless. Bloomberg is also a super cool company, but I wasn't sure that I'd be able to commit myself to a NY company at this time because I don't think any of my friends are going to NY this year.

Edit:
Got offers from both MSFT and FB, decided to take FB over Fall.
Wanted to share feedback for my search this summer

Radio Silence from Goldman Sachs after hackerrank. 
Have a Hirevue for JP Morgan that I need to complete. 

Awaiting Hackerrank: Akuna Capital for a C++ role.

This was somewhat ordered chronologically. I’m still on the coding challenge stages of some companies (Poshmark, Redbubble, Hudson River Trading, Honey), but I likely won’t be pursuing these. 
Haven't seen many people talking about Amazon. What's their recruiting timeline looking like?
How long does amazon usually recruit interns? I applied in august and my application says under review ...

&#x200B;

But i ahve not received a challenge or anything yet. Two of my friends are in the same position.

&#x200B;

Should I be hopeful, or are my chances slim this late?
Discord or fb group for losers who couldn't secure an internship?
Has anybody taken back-to-back internships? (Summer then fall)   
If so, have you been able to get the summer company to extend your deadline until after your fall internship so you can choose between the two return offers?  
Just heard back from Google EP(Post-interview) with a rejection within a week with a phone call. Kinda upset because I felt EP was my only chance to get my foot in the door, and it would only get harder if it didn't work out. Kinda drained because I've been just studying for technical interviews only to get rejected from companies past the interview stage. :'(
Does anyone have a complied list of intern->full time return offer rate for unicorns and big n companies?
Sent out around 50 applications around September and November, got nothing. Sent out around 120 more earlier this week, so fingers crossed I get something from them. 
Just wrapped up my last internship recruiting season and thought I would contribute to this thread! 

Prior experience, I go to a target school and I had an internship at a lesser known company. I applied to over 200 companies this season, starting from early July, mainly through online applications, with and a few through my school career events. Did around 150+ LC problems (~40 easy, ~90 medium, ~20 hard) and had personal projects from last year.


Facebook: Career fair/Hackathon -> 2 phone interviews -> **Offer** (accepted!)


Optiver: Online app -> Hackerrank -> Recruiter screen -> onsites -> **Offer**


Bloomberg: Recruiter contact through school -> 2 on campus interviews -> recruiter interview -> **Offer**


Atlassian: Online app -> Hackerrank -> Recruiter screen -> 1 phone interview -> 2 final round video interviews -> **Offer**


Goldman Sachs: Online app -> Coding challenge/Hirevue -> Superday -> **Offer**


Sumo Logic: Online app -> Recruiter screen -> 2 phone interviews -> **Offer**


Cloudera: Online app -> Passed phone interview, but ghosted due to recruiting timeline (not enough time to complete process)


Airbnb: School event -> Two phone interviews -> Rejection


Google: Online app -> Snapshot -> Two phone interviews -> Rejection
 

Jane Street: Online app -> Phone interview -> Rejection


Cockroach Labs: Online app -> Recruiter screen -> Coding challenge -> Rejection




Companies that I was in the middle of interviewing with but dropped: Amazon, Qualtrics, Managed by Q (invited to onsite), Capital One (invited to onsite), Peloton, Pinterest, Checkr, Box

Coding challenge rejections/ghost: Two Sigma, Citadel, Palantir, IMC, Stripe, Virtu, SIG, Roblox, Dropbox, WorldQuant

Immediate rejections: Quora, DRW, Braintree, DE Shaw, Reddit, Github, Robinhood, Riot Games


Notable companies that ghosted: Salesforce, Apple, Jump Trading, Coinbase, Microsoft, Uber





I think I had a pretty good recruiting season this year and my key takeaways are:

* Having a compelling offer (deadline) in hand allows you to expedite interview processes and improves advancement rate.


* Coding challenges were my biggest bottleneck (besides ghosting), as I got offers with most companies where I advanced past their coding challenge.

Has Visa got back to anyone here? It's been a month since the Hackerrank. 
Just wondering, to what extent does my visa status (F-1) affect my applications? I feel like my peers who have a similar experience to me, but are either US citizens/Green Card, are getting more responses for their internship applications. 
Anyone have any insight on Khan Academy's interview process?
Anyone proceeded with Spotify?  
I just got notified from Spotify - UK that they are not continuing with my application :(
Someone posted this on cscareerquestions, but I thought it would be useful here, it's a list of 400ish companies that have quick applications: [https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application](https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application)
Hey guys! Thought I might as well share my offers since everyone else is doing it. 

Sophomore at rank ~50 state school

Hi guys, I thought I'd share my internship search like everybody else:

Amazon (AWS): return offer ($7850 / mo + housing)

Microsoft AI: phone screening -> onsite interviews -> offer ($7300 / mo + housing, **accepted**)

Google: online coding samples -> 3 technical interviews -> rejected

I decided to take Microsoft over Amazon because of better work-life balance.
Amazon vs Bloomberg for SWE intern if I want to maximize callbacks for next year?
I'm a freshman and really excited for the summer!

* Google EP > 2 In person interviews > Offer [Accepted]
* Facebook > Video interview
* Twitter > Rejected

And I haven't heard back from Amazon and Spotify. 
Finally finished with the internship search. I'm a freshman at a midtier canadian university (uOttawa) and I tried applying to jobs on my own (77 in total) with no success (2 phone interviews) but my coop program saved me (applied to 145 jobs through COOP).

Stats: 9.6/10 GPA, URM with summer research @ uni as main experience:

&#x200B;

FacebookU, Microsoft Explore, Google EP, Amazon FE -> Ghosted or rejected after resume screen.

\~112 jobs -> Ghosted.   


95 jobs -> Rejected after resume screen.   

Google SWE, TwitterU, IBM -> Rejected after coding challenge.   

National Defence, Nuclear Lab, RCMP, Ford, Small tech company, National research council -> Rejected or ghosted after interview

&#x200B;

2 different ML research jobs with different gov research centers, mid-sized ML/Cybersecurity startup -> offers

I went with the startup. Very grateful that my uni has a strong coop program and I'm actually gonna be getting some experience in a field I'm interested in after freshman year.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;
Got an offer from GoDaddy! Super stoked as my only other offer was from JPMorgan and I was not so excited about working for a bank 
Is it too late to find an internship? Im seeing postings on LinkedIn for roles from reasonably big-name companies, but is cold applying on LinkedIn worth it now? 
Can anyone provide any insights to Walmart Labs SDE internship positions?  
I've noticed a lot of internship posts being released on their portal in the last 1 and half month or do ?  Has anyone got any response from them?
Brief overview of my job search like others have been posting:

- Facebook (rejected on resume after referral, a little salty)
- Nvidia (rejected on resume after referral)
- Stripe (rejected on challenge)
- IMC Trading (rejected on challenge)
- Palantir (I cancelled after phone screen)
- Convoy (I cancelled after phone screen)
- Asana (I cancelled after phone screen)
- Microsoft (ghosted after invited to onsite)
- Salesforce (return offer)
- Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (offer)
- Riot Games (offer)
Anyone hear back from Roblox or Twillio? Recently did their hackerrank but I was wondering if anyone has heard back after completing it. 
I did Hackerrank for Atlassian like 6 weeks ago and I just got an email for interview. Guys never give up
I had two phone interviews for a Google SWE internship last Wednesday, and at the end of the first one said "I hope your next one goes just as well," and my second interviewer said in the end he was "really happy" with the way I implemented the design problem. At first I was happy, but then I thought maybe they were just being nice because its been a week and a half already and no response, so Im starting to lose hope.
Does Google send out formal rejections ?
Anyone heard back or get an Online Assessment for Amazon Canada internship (Future Eng or SDE Intern)? 
got amazon oa1 and did it yesterday. my friends confirmation (who did it with me) mentioned a timeline for when they'd get back as well as potential next steps if he passes. mine just said that my submission was received. is this something to worry about


Having a horrible season rn, finishing my junior year at a local state school

30 applications sent so far, 3 rejections (Goldman, jane street, Asana)
Gonna send out as many more as I can, being located in NYC helps but I'm desperate for any position
Is there any information on how many people are rejected from Google internship applications without even getting an interview after completing the coding sample and project preference questionnaire? This happened to me on both US and EMEA roles (applied through employee referral on Nov 1st). I believe I did the coding sample perfectly (there was no coding sample at all for the EMEA roles), my skills/project preferences also seem pretty reasonable to me (C++, Python, Tensorflow, compilers, DS & algorithms, did Google Summer of Code before, graduating with BS in summer and proceeding to MS). That was unexpected, I can't really understand why.
Here's my results, in the order I applied:

&#x200B;

Xtern: applied -> coding challenge -> five in-person interviews in Indianapolis -> offer

Twitter Academy: applied -> coding challenge -> rejected

Microsoft Explore: applied

Google EP: applied -> two coding interviews -> moved to HC -> additional coding interview -> offer

Amazon FE: applied

&#x200B;

If anybody needs any help with the applications either this year or in the future, feel free to PM me. The entire process was a pain in the ass.
Y'all ever get ghosted after they offer you an interview? Like you're talking to a recruiter on LinkedIn and they want to talk with you. So you ask what time works for them but they never respond?
Just wanted to share my recruiting year to give other sophomores hope on getting an internship.

Background: Sophomore at top 3 CS University (we're a public school), ok GPA (3.7ish), and no internship freshmen year (I taught CS instead). No notable side projects.

Google EP: interview, offer, accepted
Amazon: OA1 and OA2, interview, offer
Facebook: interview (declined)
Goldman Sachs, Twitter, Microsoft, Airbnb, Salesforce, Twilio (the list goes on): ghosted 
Anyone here a former Amazon intern? Wondering what your experience was like at Amazon 
I didn’t get a full time return offer from Google (I think it’s because I didn’t do well on one of the conversion interviews). Is it worth anything at this point to ask my recruiter if I could be considered for a returning internship (where they only evaluate internship performance)? I recently found out that I need to stay another semester. 
Everyone's doing one of these so I thought I might contribute:

* Amazon: return offer
* Snowflake Computing: 2 Phone Interviews -> Offer
* Affirm: Hackerrank -> On Campus Interview -> Phone Interview -> Onsite -> Offer
* Quora: Phone Interview -> Onsite -> Offer
* Flexport: Phone Interview -> Virtual Onsite -> Offer
* Linkedin: 2 Phone Interviews -> Host Matching
* Google: Snapshot -> 2 Phone Interviews -> Additional Phone Interview -> Host Matching

&nbsp;

* Palantir: Phone Interview -> Onsite -> Rejected
* Stripe: Hackerrank -> Phone Interview -> Onsite -> Rejected
* Sentry.io: On-Campus Interview -> Phone Interview -> Rejected
* Optiver: Hackerrank -> Onsite -> Rejected
* Etsy: Hackerrank -> Onsite -> Rejected
* Handshake: Phone Interview -> Take Home Project -> Rejected

&nbsp;

* Canceled: Airbnb, Citadel, Databricks, Flatiron Health, Nutanix, Salesforce, Thumbtack, Redfin, Memsql, Datadog
* Resume Rejections: KPCB Fellows, Google APM, Linkedin APM, Jane Street, Robinhood, Squarespace(??), Two Sigma
* Ghosted: Way too many to count, notable ones being Lyft, Slack, Dropbox, Facebook, and Pinterest

&nbsp;

I remember freshman year feeling frustrated at the lack of callbacks I had, so it's great to finally get some responses. Don't give up hope and work hard!
Another (happy) update! I had final rounds with Uber and Two Sigma and received good news. Was at FB last year. Here's my current status:


Facebook -> **Return Offer**

Microsoft -> On Campus Interview -> Onsite -> **Offer**

Two Sigma -> Coding Challenge -> Onsite -> **Offer**

Optiver -> Coding Challenge -> Phone Interview -> Onsite -> **Offer**

Quora -> On Campus Interview -> Onsite -> **Offer**

Flexport -> On Campus Interview -> Phone Interview -> **Offer**

Uber -> On Campus Interview -> Phone Interview -> **Offer**

Stripe -> Coding Challenge -> Phone Interview -> Pending Onsite

Lyft -> Pending Phone Interview

Citadel -> Coding Challenge -> Phone Interview -> ***Rejected***

Slack, Square, Databricks, Blend, Airbnb, Box, Dropbox, Rubrik -> No Response


I'm very fortunate to have the offers that I do. I'm currently thinking of either going to Quora or Two Sigma, but if anyone has advice or experience with any of these companies I'd really appreciate it.
Just got the Amazon OA1 invite.

If I make it to Seattle I'm inviting you all to a rager at my place. There will be a 99/1 ratio of men to women. Seattle Summer Sausagefest 2019 gonna be lit

Does anyone know what the difficulty of the Firefox hackerrank is (for content security)? It's 6 hours long
Hello, I am currently a junior, and I have no internships. I go to a top 15 CS state school. I have applied to over 150 jobs, and went to my school's career fair. The only companies that have responded to me are 3 from the career fair. Two of which rejected me and one more has been taking a while to get back from final round interview. None of these companies are especially large, and I am just trying to find experience. I dont think my interviewing skills are bad or anything. The interviews I had with these companys all went well and I am very worried that It is too late to find an internship now.

I find that so many people around me are getting internships, even those who I feel dont deserve it as much as me. Please help me, I will PM those great souls who can give me guidance my resume. THANKS :)
Microsoft just requested a Skype interview for an internship. I thought MS was done hiring summer interns? Didn't many people who passed the phone interview not get their on-sites?

Also, what can I expect in the phone screen? Leetcode mediums/hards?
Anyone in google's intern project matching? I've been in project matching stage for three weeks and didn't hear anything yet. And the recruiter said we only have 6 weeks and after that our profile will be taken out from the pool.
Man are there any companies still hiring or is it over by now? 
Anyone still in the loop for Uber?
Interviewed for Google EP, and after 4 weeks, got an update saying that I'm being moved over to the SWE internship process (since they felt I'd be better suited for it). Anybody else go through a similar process (not sure how much more interviewing I'll have to do)? I can't find much about it, and would love to hear anybody's experiences!
I applied for practicum and didn't get an acceptance or rejection email yet. Also applied to the SWE role and just got a interview...

What do I make of that? 
here is my internship search... thank goodness it’s over. for a bit of background, graphics is my area of interest so i was trying really hard to get an internship in that area. glad it worked out in the end

I just got a rejection mail from Google for the fall internship without even any coding challenge. Did the same thing happen to someone here?
Anyone else get rejected by Google for Fall 2019 without even getting an interview or coding sample? I have a solid school/GPA/resume and have been getting interviews at a lot of companies, so I was pretty bummed when I received the rejection.
[Mozilla](https://careers.mozilla.org/listings/?position_type=Intern) just opened! Some pretty cool looking work.
[https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/113941684/soc-system-level-test-engineer-intern?team=STDNT](https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/113941684/soc-system-level-test-engineer-intern?team=STDNT) (To comply with the post requirements, but it seems like Apple is not hiring many more interns for the rest of the semester)  
Currently a sophomore at a top-10 CS school and here's my progress: feel free to ask any questions:  


Apple: On-Campus -> Phone Interview -> Take Home Coding Challenge -> Phone Interview -> **Offer**

Microsoft: On Campus -> Onsite -> **Rejected**

Facebook: Referral -> Phone Interview -> **Rejected**

Previous Internship: **Return Offer**

Too Many Companies to Count: -> **Ghosted/Rejected**
I just started applying this week. After reading this thread I cannot help but feel behind :)

How long has it typically taken for companies to respond to your initial application?
From a somewhat lazy sophomore's perspective who didn't put too much effort into the process.

* Vanguard -> Offer I couldn't refuse (will probably accept)
* Ford -> Offer
* Fidelity -> On-site (I cancelled)
* Random niche consultancy -> Waiting after multiple interviews and tech challenge
* Microsoft -> On-campus interview I'm going to do for practice
* The other 40 or so applications -> resume black hole/rejection

Due to the magic of a certain hurricane my University's career fair got pushed back so I couldn't really take advantage of it. Having some related work experience on my resume (web dev IT department stuff) was nice as it is what I primarily talked about in interviews. Since I couldn't be bothered with all those leetcode shenanigans and major side projects (at least this year, mans is busy), I didn't put much effort into going for any of the west coast big names, rather focusing on more traditional east coast/midwest companies where tech isn't necessarily their focus. Makes for an easier time.

I know some of y'all get college confidential style nervy about this stuff, but rest assured you'll land somewhere if you do everything right. Could I have done "better"? Certainly. Next year I'm definitely going to put in a lot of work to get the best offer possible. However, I'm just glad I have a well paying summer job in a city where all my squad from high school will be with a company I really like :D
Might as well share my progress here since everyone else has. I'm only including companies where I got at least to a phone interview (i.e not just HackerRanks).

* Optiver: Phone interview -> On-site -> Rejection
* Akuna Capital: Phone interview -> Final round -> Rejection
* BookBub: Video interview -> Rejection
* Red Ventures: Phone interview -> Rejection
* Garmin: Phone interview -> Declined to take (no interest in the company)
* Clearwater Analytics: Phone interview -> Declined to take (no interest in the company)
* Virtu Financial: Phone interview -> Rejection
* Bloomberg: Phone interview -> On-site -> Rejection
* Databricks: Recruiter call -> Phone interview -> Rejection
* IMC Trading: Accepted offer
* Citadel: Phone interview -> Recruiter call -> I cancelled (already accepted the offer at this point)
* Citrix: Phone interview -> Declined to take (already accepted the offer at this point)
* LendingHome: Phone interview -> Declined to take (already accepted the offer at this point)
* Valassis Digital: Phone interview -> Declined to take (already accepted the offer at this point)

I've also had coding challenge invitations from various other companies which I've either failed or declined to do. Off the top of my head, I've gotten challenges from Illumio, Visa, Wolverine Trading, McKinsey, MathWorks, Two Sigma, Atlassian, BlackRock, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Peloton, and a few others.




* Google (Winter 2019): Coding Challenge -> Phone Interview -> Hiring Committee -> Rejection
* Activision: Campus Interview -> Rejection
* MongoDB: Phone Screen (scheduled)
* Etsy: Coding Challenge -> On-site  -> **Offer!**
* Flatiron Health: Coding Challenge -> Video Interview (scheduled)
* Factual: Phone Interview (scheduled)

Received coding challenges for Twitter, LendingHome, Roblox, VISA, and Twilio but haven't heard back from them.
missed a call from goldman sachs, this was a week after the superday. hopefully some good news but preparing myself emotionally for the worse.
Hey guys, how many of your who interned at G received return offers (SWE -> SWE) and how fast it was/was it guaranteed?

It's been 2 weeks of silence since my recruiter submitted my packet for HC, and I've just got another offer with 2 weeks deadline, thinking whether I should take it instead. Thanks!
Anyone heard back from Amazon? I applied maybe about a month ago and only got the email stating I've been identified as a candidate. My applications profile now states "You have not submitted your profile to any positions", and I haven't gotten the OA. Is it safe to say I've been rejected?
Anyone get an offer from Google EP yet?
Has anyone heard back from Cisco yet for SWE Intern?
Didn't do too well on the EP phone interviews :/
I have an interview tomorrow, but I'm way underqualified -- I haven't learned about things like hash maps, trees, sorting algorithms, linked lists, etc. yet. Pretty nervous but I guess there's nothing really to do but to sucker through it.

Just made it to hiring committee for Google EP! Are my chances pretty good at this point? Also, my committee review date is 11/29. Will Google have filled its sophomore quota by then? Thanks for everyone's advice <3

Anyone with experience interviewing with Two Sigma for summer internship?

Hey guys I just finished the Google snapshot coding sample. Does anyone know how long they take to get back?

Also I did a brute force method for one question and an optimized solution for the other, do the people who get past this round usually have an optimized solution for both?
Anyone applied to/heard back from Apple for summer 2019?
Anyone else hear back from Amazon SDE Internship? Just got an email to expect SDE Assessment, was wondering if anyone had any advice about the process (What do we do in the Online Assessments Part 1 and Part 2, and final technical interview). Thanks a lot in advance!
Should I push my onsite with Quora internship until after the holidays? It would give me more time to prep, but I’m not sure if they are about to be filled at this time. 
Got a Google EP interview! Any tips/advice for preparing??? TY
Does anyone know what to expect from the Amazon LiveCode interview (e.g. does the website compile and run the code, and how many questions are there)?
I completely bombed Amazon’s OA1 debugging part (1/7), but I feel pretty confident on the logic part. Anyone do really bad on debugging but make it through?

Anyone do the OA2 for Amazon? What kind of questions should I prepare for?

Hi ﻿BLablabl

We are still in the process of sharing your resume with teams and will contact you directly if a team is interested in your profile and would like to begin the interview process.

Please note, if you have already received or completed the coding challenge, it is not mandatory but it is in your best interest to complete the coding challenge for engineering roles at Twitter.

Feel free to hmu for any help or questions! Always happy to help

Has anyone been able to land an internship even though he requires having a visa sponsership. I feel like needing to have one is really stopping me from having an intern aboard even if I am qualified for the job so if someone was able to get a job offer though, can you give me some insight about it? Like were you just qualified or over qualified and which company was it...etc if someone can do that I would be quite grateful
Any companies still hiring? I’ve been applying actively but I would love some suggestions from the community. So far I’ve only been searching on LinkedIn and indeed 
Are there any companies that still open for summer internship and they want to sponsor for a work visa? It's okay if the company is not in US though
I'm applying for the Amazon Summer SDE internship. I finished both parts of the online assessment (got 7/7 on debug, logic section gave me a little trouble). Part 2 I solved one question but I didnt pass all the hidden test cases for the second question. 

I didn't get an interview request until a month after I finished the online assessment. Since it looks like most people got their interview request right away, how screwed am I?
Discord or fb group for FB SWE interns?
I got a “aptitude” assessment from Visa that I was supposed to take. It was like a video game with logical puzzles, and it had 10 parts. Woulda taken at least an hour. 

I found this ridiculous, and quit like 2 parts in. What the hell? Shit was dumb. These companies are getting weirder and weirder with their hiring. 
Hi there, I just got an offer from AWS Amazon in Seattle. However, I never actually applied to that specific position (I only applied to the Canadian roles). I was wondering if it is common practice for them to transfer you without notifying you?
I'm done!

\*Google EP -> Phone Interviews -> Offer

Got dicked over by Google now I am applying for a bunch of internships as a junior and its way too late in the game :( Getting some rejections and barely anymore coding screens. Any places that's still looking for interns or about to start hiring?
Well damn I can say looking at this thread makes me feel unqualified lmao.

Sophomore - Nontarget school (Midwest)

Thomson-Reuters -> Hirevue -> [no response so far]  
US-Bank -> Phone -> Interview -> rejected   
Google EP -> Upcoming phone interview

I am pretty much sending out a ton of applications but I am putting all my hope into EP at this point. If that fails then I'll go off to the spring recruitment season. I started applying for things in October so maybe that was part of it but just telling myself I'm fine even if I don't get anything this year is whats keeping me positive =)


Are there any international students who got internships in the US? How did it go for you?
Anyone have any idea how many interns Amazon hires? It seems like everyone is getting offers from them right now.

How does Capital One compare to IBs like Goldman, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, etc.? 

In terms of both reputation for getting past resume screens as well as the internship experience.
Just got rejected from my last two on-sites last week and have no more interviews scheduled. I've applied to all of the companies on the github and then some. I'm freaking out cause I feel like internship season is already over. 
I contacted a google campus recruiter and they said that it might take 3-4 weeks for my resume to go through the initial screening phase because of the high load. I am worried that it might be too late given that people are already receiving offers.

Akuna asked me for my availability for a phone screen, and then didn't get back to me for around 2 weeks with a final date. They called me yesterday, but I missed it. Didn't mail me/call me back today. I'm not sure what's the etiquette here, do I mail my recruiter apologising for missing the call and ask if she could mail me an update? Or do I just wait for them to contact me again?
whats amazon's compensation like for interns in canada?
Have anyone done an interview for AT&T internship? Anyone at LA location? I already got through the online assessment and phone interview with HR.

I had mistakenly applied for the Amazon Future Internship program instead of Software Development Engineer intern, and it’s “ No longer under consideration” right away without an online assessment because I think that is for students up to 2nd year where as I am a 3rd year student. 

Does this mean I now have to wait 6 months to apply for the right Software Development Engineer intern? 

Thanks, 

Has anyone heard back from Spotify? The link they gave me to check the application status expired. Not sure if that means anything.

Looks like my summer season is wrapped up. For context, I'm a sophomore with 3 previous summer internships and two part-time jobs (consulting and IT), applying for mostly data science roles. 

Companies this year:

Amazon: HireVue + numeracy test -> 2x phone calls -> **Offer**

Visa: 'Game-based assessment' -> Interview offer -> Interview next week but will probably reject. 

Airbus: 'Game-based assessment' -> Interview offer -> Said no to interview

Samsung: Phone screen -> Interview offer -> Said no to interview

Small startup: Phone screen -> Offer -> Said no to offer

Jane Street (quant role): Phone screen -> Rejection

Twitter: Contact from recruiter -> Coding test -> Rejection

Google, FB, Amazon, Nasdaq, Thomson Reuters, ... -> Rejection based on resume or year of graduation. 

Everywhere else ghosted me.  
I just got an offer from Amazon in the AWS department as a software engineering intern for the summer 2019. Feel free to ask me questions about the interview process or about me!

I can try to answer questions about Amazon/Asana interview process if anyone is as nervous as I was about them
Recently took Amazon Virtual Interview. I sent my availability last week a couple days after getting the email, and was scheduled for today. Interview went mediocre, I got a lot of the pseudo stuff and concepts, but had dumb syntactical errors and was definitely crusty on my Java (it showed). We only worked on one problem, but in two parts. Interviewer pretty much skipped over the behaviorals. 

&#x200B;

People who have already done this: How should I be feeling? Good? Bad? I'm really pissed at myself for the dumb errors and stupid thoughts I had during the nervousness of the interview, but I'm hoping the interviewer sees through that.

&#x200B;

Anyone get an offer after a mediocre/bad interview? Anyone get rejected with what they thought was a good interview? 

&#x200B;

any advice/experience helpful, pm me if anything!

Has anyone gotten a message like this from Verizon? This makes it sound like I'm moving on to the next step but at the same time not...

Thanks for completing your video interview. After reviewing the information you submitted, we’d like to move onto the next steps. Congrats!

Next up, your information will be reviewed by our Verizon business partners to see if you match any available opportunities. If so, you’ll be invited to either a Super Day event at one of our office locations, or a virtual interview.

We’ll reach out with additional details if you are selected to move forward. Please note that this process may take a few months as we continue to assess our open positions.
Has anyone done the E-Trade on-demand interview? Is it behavioral or is there a coding section involved?

I applied to Google SWE Intern position and EP on 4weeks ago (Sep 17th/18th) and still haven't heard back. Anyone else?
Study tips for Google EP interviews? This has been one of the only things to work out so far with ~250 applications (3 interviews between SWE, quant, and data science internships). I really want this to workout because the application/rejection process is wearing on me. Motivation is also welcome if you cant provide study tips lol

Edit: thread rule, Google EP application:

For summer 2019 internship, some company offered me an onsite as the final interview after phone screen, but they say they're full until 4 January.  Should I try to persuade them somehow to pull it back? Because I am afraid of them filling their hiring quota until then. However, that date would actually be better for me, since their office is \~14  hour flight from my country and I have a busy school schedule (my winter holiday starts in january).

What do you suggest?

 I applied to Amazon's Summer 2019 SDE internship and Twilio's Summer 2019 SWE position.

&#x200B;

I did the OA parts 1 and 2 for Amazon about 3 weeks ago and haven't heard anything from them. I received and completed Twilio's hackerrank a week ago.

Has anyone heard from either of these places? Thanks
I have an interview with Rakuten today. I need to showcase my research experience. I got the call after attending the on-campus seminar and a coding round. Though I don't have any research experience in ML and NLP, I been given a chance now. My primary areas of research lie in the fields of Computational Geometry, Model Predictive Control. Any tips on how I should be approaching this interview? I have prepared slides that basically explain about my research experiences and how I can contribute to Rakuten's research community.

Crossposting this question from /r/cscarrerquestions

I'm going to try to do *Google Summer Of Code* next summer. If that fails, I want to have an internship lines up so I'm not completely out of options.

I was going to go about this by speculatively applying to small-ish (< 400 employee, approx.) companies that aren't advertising some internship program.

My problem is I don't actually know how to go about finding small companies that aren't publicly advertising internship programs. Does anyone here have experience with speculative applications?

Maybe I should add: Location wise anywhere in the US or EU would work for me.

I'm still in the app stage for Facebook University, as the apps closed just a few days ago, but I have an offer deadline coming soon. Will a recruiter be willing to push up my process for that/is it worth emailing one?
didn't get all the debugging for amazon oa. is that an automatic no from them?
Anyone else get the HackerRank from Two Sigma for their Freshman Program?
People are talking how Google host matching finishes on mid-November and stuff. I just got a snapshot 2-3 days ago (SWE). I feel like I'm way late to the party, huh?
Has anyone given the coder block challenge for HBO 2019 summer internship? What should i expect?
Has anyone gone through the salesforce IT swe internship process and mind sharing?

Also has anyone worked at the Dallas office?
Anyone get the Under Armour hirevue?
Is there any hope for FBU? I remember someone said if you don't hear back by December it's a rejection.
Anyone interviewed at Cisco? Have one coming up next week. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

Anyone has an idea about Akamai, got a software intern offer(Cambridge)
Just completed OA2 for Amazon.  Was wondering for those that got interviews how many of the test cases you passed? I was only able to pass like 70% of them.  Not really expecting an interview after that, but who knows.
So I got an invite to the first step of Amazon's SDE internship assessment yesterday. Took the assessment, didn't think I killed it, then immediately got an email back saying they weren't going to more forward with my application. But then, this morning, I get an email from them inviting me to step two of the internships assessment? Has this happened to anyone else?
Took Amazon OA1 and missed two of the debugging questions because I got stuck on one and didn't pay attention to the time. Did pretty well on the logic though. I just got an invite for OA2, am I already screwed if I messed up on part 1?
[deleted]
I just completed the virtual interview with Amazon for the SDE internship yesterday and was wondering how long it usually takes to hear back from them. Also do they let you know if you are rejected as well as if you have an offer?
Hi all, taking my Amazon OA2 this week, any advice on what specific things I should practice? I took the demo OA2 they sent and it was super easy (finished both questions passing all test cases) but assuming that doesn't reflect the actual OA2 difficulty level? Also, those who got offers, did they give you a hard start date or are open to letting you choose a time period in the summer?
Regarding Amazon's SDE internship, are you allowed to use python for the virtual interview after the OA2 since its with an actual engineer?
Anyone get a coding challenge from Quid??? I just finished up mine yesterday and I thought I might be late to the game (received the email about it Feb 27). 
Did anyone bomb their Amazon video interview and still get an offer? I don't think I did that well :/
Anyone who got a call from Amazon for virtual interview in the last one week?
Just took my amazon virtual interview and I did pretty badly, couldn't figure out a solution to the coding problem that met the complexity requirement (though upon looking up the problem, I was close), think I still have a chance to get the internship? I made sure to keep talking in the whole process and went over each of my proposed solutions in detail along with calculating their complexity.
Alright guys, this is probably my saltiest season of all time. At this point my body is filled with sadness and sodium. 

Junior in a top 3 Canadian school, not known for CS but good for science in general. Had 3 previous internships, 1 non tech, 1 R&D in a startup, 1 data integration / dev for a startup. 

Google: Snapshot -> two phone interviews -> additional interview -> Passed HC -> Passed Project Match -> Rejected by offer committee. 

Thomson Reuters Toronto; Hackerrank -> two phone screens -> offer (accepted)

Riot games: Hackerrank -> passed but was told position is filled 

Palantir: Hackerrank -> rejected

Twitter : Hackerrank -> Ghosted

Rejected at resume stage: Microsoft, Air bnb, Blizzard, Citadel, JP Morgan, SAP, Reddit, Flatiron, Asana, Quora and a couple more, Although I am not sure how many of these are because I applied too late due to not applying to other things after Google. 

Awaiting: Paypal, Tesla, Amazon, Twitter, Lyft, Uber, Apple

&#x200B;

Read my post history for some salt overload. 
Progress report, I'm a junior who did an internship at Google last summer. (CS Major @ top 10, non-CS school)

* Google > return offer
* Two Sigma > pending results from on-site
* Pending on-site: Palantir, Etsy, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg
* Pending second round interviews: Tesla, Reddit, Duolingo, Square, Plaid
* Pending first round interviews: Quora, Airbnb, Stripe
* Rejected after phone screen: Facebook, D.E. Shaw
* Coding challenges I'm ignoring/have zero time to do: Atlassian, Box, AQR, Peloton, Cloudflare
Anyone know how long it takes to hear back from Google EP after the 2 phone interviews (specifically Google STEP as I applied for the European program)? Got a couple offer deadlines  so it would be good to hear back asap.

I was invitied for FB Data Challenge 2019: They are going to fly me out and put me in a hotel. I am just wondering if it is possible  if I could get an internship from this experience.
[deleted]
I'll just drop another data point in here now that I'm basically done:

* Google -> return offer
* American Express -> live video interview -> offer
* Capital One -> onsite, declined
* Bloomberg, LinkedIn, Lyft -> phone interview, declined
* Microsoft -> on campus interview -> ghosted
* Goldman Sachs -> coding/math challenge  -> Hirevue -> ghosted
* JP Morgan -> Hirevue -> ghosted; was invited to Code for Good but declined
* Palantir, Akuna, Barclays, Okta, Peloton, Twitter -> coding challenge that I either didn't do or half-assed
* Appian, Asana, DE Shaw, Jane Street, Two Sigma -> resume rejection

The rest of my applications (\~40 in total including above) are in the void somewhere. Still this is way better than my attempts last year and ended a lot earlier so I'm happy.
Just wondering if it’s too late to be able to get an internship for the summer. I am a junior transfer student and I’m just realizing that like all of you guys are getting interviewed and shit. I don’t care if it’s with a big company or not, I just want exposure (besides with my grades and GPA, I’m sure a big company won’t take me).
I just received a Hirevue invite from the Under Armour Technology Internship and I didn't realize the program began when I'm still in school. I have to submit my response by Friday. How should I move forward while still being professional?
I’ve only taken Intro to CS 1+2 and Discrete Math so far. Somehow got an intern interview with google. I have 0 leetcode experience and very little data structures or algorithm knowledge. I am going to get ass blasted aren’t I...

My friends who didn't do well have already been called for third interviews and I'm just worried that for some reason I didn't get through. Should I ask for a follow up or is it too early?
Grubhub SWE internships anyone? Also how's facebook uni?
This is painful, I just got a very good offer from one startup company.

However, it expires in 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

I really really wanna go to Google and I am on host-matching.

Even if get reject from Google, I still wanna go to more well-known company.

&#x200B;

And some companies like Snap, Tinder, Spotify didn't even start the hiring process yet.

I don't want to blow chances for them.

&#x200B;

I thought getting an offer will be super good, but I just realized it's actually painful.

What should I do?

Anyone got back something from Uber or Coinbase after you applied online?
Okay, I got really good offer from Lendinghome and it expires tomorrow.

I am still on the hiring process with a few companies.

&#x200B;

Although Lendinghome offer is really good and location is perfect, I dont know why my heard is not moving toward it.

I think I want to work for more well known service.

&#x200B;

I already rejected two other offers. Maybe I am a dumb that doesnt know how to be satisfied...

&#x200B;

I want to know if there are still more rooms for companies. It's already almost December.

Is it too late to reject offers? Or can I try for more companies?

Should I just accept the offer? I am confused and having a very hard time to decide. I couldn't even sleep last night.

&#x200B;

Please help with an advice. 

Thank you

Hey people. I'm in need of some advice. I'm currently an intern doing standard helpdesk stuff, slinging tickets and whatnot- nothing too wild. But, I like my bosses and my coworkers. I expressed to them in the past that I'd love to stay with them as long as I can. However, I just got an internship offer for a software developer position at a startup in my city. It is more in line with my career goals and pays twice as much with the same amount of hours, and it is downtown where I love working. Sounds like an obvious choice but I'm having trouble building up the gall to tell my beloved bosses that I'm leaving when I just said I'd like to stay for a while. I am also a notorious people-pleaser. Anyone gone through the same thing?

Doing my virtual interview for amazon this week... won't be completely sad if I don't get it because I'm still applying, but it would be so nice to just get an offer and accept and be done w interviewing for this summer!! Wish everyone else going in for their interviews in the upcoming week good luck! You got this :) 
Did anyone hear back today about an offer from Amazon who took the virtual interview last week? 
I wanna get an internship, however I feel like it’s too late seeing that many of you already getting interviews and hell even accepted. I didn’t know I had to apply so damn early, this is my first year where I am interested. I don’t have the best grades (slightly below a 3.0 GPA but I feel this semester is going really good as I kicked myself into gear so it’ll go up after this semester). I don’t care about a big company or not, I just want some exposure into the field. So it trying to get a summer internship a lose cause or do I still have a chance? I know I should keep applying but I don’t wanna waste the time to do it if they aren’t even gonna look at my attempt. 
Will Google ask questions like "implement a HashMap (or any data structure)" for intern interviews? Got my interviews coming up next week and I'm underprepared

Hey y’all, long time lurker but I don’t see a lot of people on here with as many pecularities as me so I thought i’d comment. Junior at a top school with a previous unicorn internship.

Ways my search was different then most students:

\-I don’t want to work at a big4. Honestly, theyre just too big and I would feel like a cog in a machine

\-I don’t have any side projects on my resume. I’m super busy with school and it’s never been a priority

\-I don’t grind leetcode or prep for interviews, I’m too busy with school.

\-I don’t believe in doing take home coding challanges. I think theyre a waste of time, and a bit disrespectful. Like, if I’m going to put in an hour, I want the company to also put in that hour to interview me. I stopped interviewing with any company that gave me a coding challange.

I applied to around \~30 companies tops:

Nordstrom: online app -> coding challange (choose not to complete)

Handshake: approached by recruiter on jumpstart -> recruiter screen -> phone interview -> onsite offer but had to complete a 4 hour coding task before the onsite (part of the onsite was going over it) so I stopped the process

Facebook+Amazon-no application -> approached by recruiters in person and offered to fast track (said no) 

Jump Street- online app -> on campus interview (completely messed up (didn’t recognize the problem as a graph problem and went down the wrong path))-> Rightly rejected. 

Godaddy- contacted by recruiter via linkedin \_. 3 phone interviews (messed up on the third)-> got rejected. 

Blackrock- contacted by recruiter via linkedin -> on campus interview -> invited for onsite (said no)

Yext- online app -> 3 phone interviews -> invited onsite (said no)

Lyft- contacted by recruiter via jumpstart-> recruiter screen -> mock interview -> 2 phone interviews -> invited for virtual onsite (said no becuase I had just accepted an offer)

Morgan Stanley- online app -> on campus interview (super specific and boring java and sql) -> rejected (would not recommend)

Atlassian-online app -> on campus interview -> sent me a coding challange (said no) 

Shift-> contacted by recruiter via linkedin -> on campus interview -> onsite -> offer 

Stripe-> online app -> phone interview -> onsite -> offer

Redfin-> contacted by recruiter via jumpstart -> phone interview -> onsite -> ghosted

Affirm- contacted by recruiter via jumpstart -> phone interview -> onsite-> offer

Bloomberg- contacted by recruiter via linkedin -> on campus interview -> onsite (said no becuase I accepted an offer)

Palantir- contacted by recruiter via linkedin -> recruiter screen -> two phone interviews (then I ghosted for ethical reasons)

Rejected on resume:

jane street, two sigma, de shaw, citadel

offered interviews (usually didn’t apply):

Dicks, Blend, PDT partners, flexport, jumpstart, nutanix, coinbase, pure storage, appDynamics, sentry, nerdwallet, qualtrics, samsara, datavisor, teachers pay teachers, redbubble, goldman sachs, classpass, knewton, lendinghome, willowtree, intuit, clever, ycharts, thumbtack, schlumberger, wayfair, docusign

Would love to give details if that would help anyone!

I go to Top 5 CS school but I feel like it doesn't really help me at all. I got a few offers and I think it's because of my exceptional working experience, not because of school. Landing offers were super hard and I am still having a hard time to look for internship. I see people in here mention about their school and worry about it. I believe school doesn't matter at all. Or am I wrong?

I just finished Amazon sde intern OA2 and thought it was pretty hard...and I'm a CS major at a very selective CS university. I wasn't able to finish either of the questions, didn't pass any test cases, but I almost got the first one to work and wrote about a good amount of code/pseudocode for the second. Because I didn't pass any test cases, I'm probably 100% not getting final round right?

I was able to complete both of the problems on the snapshot but I just realized that in the job description, they specified that they preferred masters students but I am currently doing my bachelors degree. Is there any chance that I might get the job? Also are there any other jobs at google that do not have a preference to masters students?
Anyone go to the interview stage for at &t?
Does anybody have any experience with the CarMax interview process? I've had 2 phone interviews so far and just wondering how much more I have in store
Anyone had a phone interview for a C++ summer internship at Akuna Capital? What can I expect?
Is Barclays expected to call more people for on site? Is anyone still waiting to hear back from them?
I did a google snapshot on the 22nd of December, and still haven't received a response. How long should I wait before sending an email? I am aware google often take around 1.5-2 weeks, but should I factor in the Christmas/new year break?

Anybody know anything about Duck Creek internship?
Have a technical interview with Zuora coming up. Anyone have an idea of what kind of questions to expect?
I applied for my first internship, and I got a referral from someone in the company so I think I have a decent change at getting an interview. The thing is I've never really done leetcode or other questions like that although I own cracking the coding interview but haven't touched it much. I was thinking of reading the job requirements one more time to make sure I'm prepared to talk about that as well as prepare for soft questions like "explain a situation where you struggled" or "do you have any questions for us". But with the short time frame that I have, what leetcode questions should I seek out? It's a local company not Big N and the position is for Java so I'll probably practice coding problems in Java. Would love any advice.
Are there any companies that accept Community College internships. Not for Summer '19 but will be applying for Summer '20.

anyone have experience with Akuna's trading internship phone interview?
I reached out to a Software Engineer at the company I'm applying for an internship. I'm really glad he responded and agreed to do a quick chat tomorrow about his work and what they're looking for in interns.

Now I'm shitting bricks because I don't know what to say to make this into something meaningful. Should I ask for a referral at the end of the chat? I feel like that's too much to ask

For those of you who have heard back from Amazon after taking OA2, how long did it take to get a response?

I took it last Wednesday and I'm anxious to hear back mostly because I feel I did really well. I passed every test case with time remaining to comment out and optimize my code. Is it safe to assume I'll move on? I know this might seem like a humble-brag but I feel really anxious about this.

Button data science challenge anyone?
Question:

right now I'm in the pipeline for Amazon's summer internship (I've completed OA2 like 3 weeks ago but haven't heard back yet).

I applied way back in october, and my resume since then has improved drastically (about 5 months of work). Is it worth it to reach out to my recruiter and send him/her my updated resume, or does it not really make a difference since I'm already past the resume screen stage?

Tbh I'm kinda leaning towards sending my resume cus it'll give me an excuse to ask about any updates
Anyone hear back from Northwell Health after the technical interview?
Hi, I solved Amazon OA1 but I didn't receive a confirmation mail after finishing it, is this normal ? Also, I applied to the internship position in Cape town, after few days I received a mail that I am not qualified, OK it happens a lot, then few days later I received a mail saying that they cannot consider me for this position because my application is not complete and I should complete it, so I tried to access it from my online account at the jobs portal but I have no luck. So if you know anything about this and what I should do, I will be very glad to hear from you. Thanks!

Does anyone has idea about which location is better of Amazon SDE intern? Bay area vs Seattle w.r.t Projects, housing and other factors?
Do your scores/performance on OA1 and OA2 also play a role in deciding if you get an offer or not, or is it only your performance in the final interview? This is for an SDE internship at Amazon.
Amazon sde oa2
i am so obsessed with google SWE intern interview.


I got a request for an additional tech (3rd) interview on last Friday. I heard Host Matching is already started. So I wanna take the third interview asap for better chance. But scheduling the third interview takes so long time. I didnt get a date for the interview yet. I am so worried. Am I done with google?
[deleted]
I didn’t, but my roommate did and they asked him some not too difficult mental math and probability questions. Nothing too serious but if you haven’t prepared those kinds of questions, I def would 
Like 3-4 days
I applied to Technical Intern on Amazon and saw that my application is now 'Under Consideration', as opposed to 'Application Submitted' for other positions. Anyone know what that means in terms of likelihood of getting an interview?


So I took Amazon's OA2 and passed all test cases for the first question but didn't get a chance to finish the second one - i did leave comments on my code indicating what i was trying to achieve. Do I have any chance of moving on to the next round? 
I didn’t pass either... good luck you guys
Feeling better now?
How did you get 50/hr at bloomberg? Did they ask about your other offers?

How was Google's host matching stage for you? I've been in the host matching for about three weeks and haven't got any host matching interviews. And the recruiter told me, I only have six weeks after that they will take out my profile from the pool.
I have a phone interview coming up! Is it mostly just a technical coding interview? Do they ask any questions about your previous work experience and get to know you questions? Do they ask any questions about your knowledge of Google products? 

For the coding part, are you allowed to use any coding language you want? And look up some standard library features online if needed for your code implementation? 

Thank you! 
What college do you attend?
$7-8000 a month.... I’d die to make that in a year. 
Congrats man! I totally agree :) 
Hey sorry this is a late reply, but can you explain a little bit about what the day to day of a business analytics person might be like compared to a regular software developer? 
Only need 1 :) Congrats!
fulltime?
Does Google do onsite interviews for intern?
How was ur preparation? Did u prioritize Cracking code the interview or leetcode more ? 
Facebook actually sends rejections?
What happened after you submitted the google snapshot
Did you already have an interview with LendingHome? How was it?
congrats!!
Yes, I just got this too! Wondering if anyone who's done the twitch internship process want to share how interviewing went?
If they reviewed our applications already, I wonder how they'll pick the remaining people?
Yuhun got it too
Yea same here!
Has anyone gotten rejections? 
I got it as well, hoping to hear something
Anyone have an update on this?  Looks like that email was a mass email sent to pretty much everyone haha
yes! hope we hear back soon
Same I've only got a few coding challenges, aced them, rejected, failed my only onsite. Someone just interview me :( 
You're not alone man
How long did Reddit take to reply to your application submission with the behavioral interview?
Pretty crazy that a lot of top candidates like you don't get any callback from Dropbox but my friend that has only a modest local startup internship got a phone interview with them after online application. Just the luck of the draw? 
Damn congrats dude. How much is the quora offer and how did you find the interviews?
Solid AF dude. I'm also super interested in Flexport (love what they do), but small companies aren't my thing so I cancelled my 2nd round. Curious - what's their offer for intern?
What did you think of Citadel's process? They are one of the only companies to get back to me and I was wondering how hard their challenges seemed compared to the other companies you applied to.

How full retard?
Yep. 
[deleted]
Congratz on the success. My school doesn't have any career fairs, so how could I get in contact with an Apple recruiter. Would you be able to send me the contact information of one of them that helped you along your hiring process?
In the same situation. Just waiting on them to send mass rejection emails I guess lol
Hi, how much time after your online test did you get an interview call for Amazon?
I’m taking the SDE OA1 and 2 soon. Any tips? 
Seriously I agree. I’m at 300+ applications and I’ve gotten an offer already. On top of that, I’m still interviewing with 4 other companies this upcoming week(s)! I’ve been killing it at these interviews too. Not sure if it’s because I have an offer or because I feel like a better interviewer now or because I’ve been on that grind since September and people are starting to notice my project, outside projects, GitHub commits #100daysofcode, better resume, grinding leetcode, etc. 

Seriously, don’t give up ladies and gents !! 
It's been hard to score interviews, although my profile is good for a graduate student.  
I think location(Upstate New York) is a huge downside for me.
Congratulations! I've been ghosted by them so far haha
congrats man! I interned at a health insurance company too during sophomore year and my team was great. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it, but it pretty much only goes up from there :) 
happy for you!
Congrats! What company?
I think this is like the most commitment I’ve ever seen. 
If you don't mind sharing, how many of your total practice questions were easy, mediums, and hards? How long would you give yourself before looking at the solution?

Also, was there a certain amount you did each day or did you just do as much as possible?
how did you get two ml swe internships pre-junior year as a non-cs major?
Same boat man. Just landed a 2/7 on debugging but feel like aced the logical part too. It's just a shame I let myself get anxious and couldn't focus until the final few minutes when I decided just to settle down and get to work. Always next year, but now it's time to follow up with local companies haha.
They take tons every year, I've heard 1000 plus in Seattle alone
really? i thought i did good and still got rejected
**Everyone** I know who applied got an invite to OA1. Yeah it does seem like they are taking a lot of interns this year. Possibily becuase they are opening 2 new HQ and want to hire them for that? I'm not sure. 
Dm'd and congrats!
Fuck I haven't heard back from oa2 yet and it's been over a week. How well did you do on oa2? 
Congrats! When did you get your offer and how long was it after your interview? 
I'm getting that vibe. Something big definitely changed this year. They aren't doing corporate housing anymore, and the pay is lower too. Maybe they decided to accept a lot more interns and save some money.
What kind of question was it? One or two? Did you even get a working solution at all?
Nice man! I never heard back from LinkedIn ): Hope it’s a fun experience for you! 
Thanks a lot! It helped me to track my application status! BTW how did you apply LinkedIn? They never reached me :(
Good God dude...Congratulations! Can't really help you with your choice but I have my Facebook interview in a week. Any tips?
Good God
Can you show your resume? Also what made you choose fb over other offers?
what was your previous experience - also did you not have to do onsite with fb?
How was the Mongo phone interview? 
Was at FB Seattle last year and had similar conflict choosing between Menlo and Seattle. You can pm me
When did pinterest reply to how? how long did it take to get back after your final interview
Did you happen to talk to Flatiron Health at a career fair? I did and they asked me to submit an electronic copy of my resume, so I uploaded it but never heard back. Do you suggest I just apply to the position online?
For Google, did you move on to host matching right after the two tech interviews in a same day?

I just got a request for an additional interview..

&#x200B;
How long did it take you to host match after you passed HC?
Mind if I message you about Stripe onsite?
Did you ever get past a coding challenge screen without passing all test cases?
difficulty rating of fb 2nd round?
Congrats! Are you a sophomore or junior?

&#x200B;

Also, any tips for the recruiting process in general? I'm still a sophomore going through it, have some interviews and etc., but no offers in hand yet. I'm starting to get discouraged but hoping to do well in my upcoming interviews to get an offer.
I interned at FB menlo park AND seattle haha so feel free to PM me. Congrats!
Oh also, what do you think about the Pinterest intern program? I don't know much about the quality of the engineers compared to FB/Google.
I have a phone interview coming up for Google. Is it mostly just a technical coding interview? Do they ask any questions about your previous work experience and get to know you questions? Do they ask any questions about your knowledge of Google products?

For the coding part, are you allowed to use any coding language you want? And look up some standard library features online if needed for your code implementation?

Thank you!
Is it just me or are they ridiculously late? 
Very likely, it definitely did not guarantee an interview or that you were moving on
What was the short quiz like? I can’t complete mine on mobile. 
[deleted]
Hey! I have few questions about fb! How long did it take for u to hear back from fb after the 2nd round (or the final round)? Also, how did u move fb to fall? Was it an option when u got the offer? Thank u so much!
Im about to go through the Facebook SWE interview process, do you have any tips or advice you can give me, please?
Congrats! Which offer did you accept?
Awesome! Congrats. When did you start your phone screen with Twitter btw?
I'd love to have a fall 2019 megathread/Github link. 
I got rejected from Goldman Sachs a few hours after bombing the hackerrank, so maybe the silence is not too bad.

How were the IMC trading interviews? Specifically everything after the logic assessment?
When did you interview for Flatiron?
I don't know about anyone else but I just got an invitation to take their coding challenge yesterday and I applied on September 6th 
They recruit through april, speaking from experience.
I just found out I am moving on to final interviews like 20 minutes ago. So just hang in there 
What's the interview process like? Hackerrank then phone or something?
I applied September 6th and just got an invite to take the coding challenge yesterday
do u have the discord link?
I'm so sorry to hear this. I felt this same way after a tech consulting company I really wanted to go to rejected me in early October. There will be more opportunities ahead! It's okay to feel sad for a while, but you've got to pick yourself up and go on! I sulked for one day and was good again, so take the weekend for yourself and focus on your health.
honestly how well did you think you did on the two phone interviews?
Try this:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gmTNiNqv5pGco-uNK7ghjwP6pa3LYpK1fr_QK-R9Pko
I'd be interested as well
Holy shit, where’d you find 120 more companies?
**nice**
What was the timeline like for Airbnb?
nope

&#x200B;
Got rejected pretty quickly after my test last month
Not for me. Internship is short enough that your CPT should cover it. Just say you don't need sponsorship and authorized to work in the U.S.

&#x200B;

The only two companies that was adamant about knowing my residency status was Worldpay and Atlassian, but that only happened after I got through 1st or 2nd round. Their reason was that they convert a lot of interns into full time employees, so they needed to be sure that I'll be able to stick around (Atlassian mentioned that they're not e-verified for STEM extension)

&#x200B;

Here are offers that I got:

Spring 2019: Philips, Autodesk, TripAdvisor, AppFolio

Summer 2019: Capital One, Akuna Capital
Rejection, applied with a referral :(
Applied w referral and rejected. From canada tho
If it's possible would you be able to send a anonimized resume? I'm a sophomore at a non flagship school and I got ghosted but almost all the companies you listed just on resume. Thank you! And congrats! 
Congrats on all the offers! Im impressed that your "non-target state school" has Microsoft, JPM and Cap 1 comming to your career fair haha. 
How was the Microsoft on-site? lc medium? And do they also ask behavorial questions?
How was the amazon technical interview? i heard some people say lc medium at most. and did they ask behavioral questions?
How does one get the AI position at MS specifically? Are you a PhD student?
That was one of the reasons I chose MS over AMZ as well. Congrats on the offers!
Awesome, congrats! Do you know what team you'll be on? I'll be in Seattle also for an internship!
prioritize team/technology/product area for the types of companies you're interested for next year then
Damn nice. You had previous experience before?
Damn, good on you for grinding so hard in first year! congrats on the startup
[deleted]
Nope it’s not too late. I am still getting calls.
big name companies is prob too late but there is always your small city companies
curious, what's the riot games offer details? did 1 interview with them and cancelled because 1) they weren't doing onsites for interns and ngl, really wanted to visit and 2) there were a lot of interviews.. really wasn't feeling it

Did them both last week.  No response yet. 
Not yet, expecting a couple weeks for Twilio. Though their hackerrank felt way to easy?

Not to be personal, but are you a minority (not Asian or White)?
Happened to me through e-mail. Recruiter claimed they "never got my e-mail" lmao. 
Just curious why did you decline facebooks interview? 
wow, great job! what do you think contributed to your success? (since you mainly listed negatives lol)
Do you know where you'll be working this summer yet or still on matching? Also what made you choose Google?
Im about to go through the Facebook SWE interview process, do you have any tips or advice you can give me, please?
Would you mind posting a redacted resume and talking a bit about how you contacted most of these companies? Like referral, career fair, just applied online?
Regarding the last sentence, did you significantly improve something or do you think it's only because of being a class year upper?
Congrats! Any idea which offer you're looking to accept?
Congratz dude, your killing it!
Considering you've already worked at a software company (FB), I'd check out Two Sigma if you're interested in trying something new.

&#x200B;

Doubt you could go wrong with either though, and you might be able to do both if you ask one to move to fall/winter.
good lord
just curious - why are you not considering fb or microsoft? i thought these would be top picks for anyone offered them
Congrats! Did you have a positive experience at FB? Currently considering taking an offer there over a unicorn.
[deleted]
bet. good luck bro!
Did you email or just apply online?
Where'd you apply for Disney?
Wow, that's pretty impressive, how did you prepare this well? 
Do you mind if I ask you about your approximate dates for Verizon? I did their video interview like 2 weeks ago and never heard back.
hows your experience with Northrop Grumman thus far? I'm crossing my fingers for an interview as its on the top of my list. 
jesus man how do you make time to juggle all of these companies? I was struggling balancing study with three concurrent interviews lmao
[deleted]
What year are you in school? Any way you could share an anonymous resume, and/or talk about the interview process for Harris and Northrop Grumman? I applied to both and I'm waiting for the interviews but pretty nervous since I'm just a freshman and have taken no coding classes whatsoever.
Did you apply online or through a career fair?
If that's the case there is probably something wrong with your resume. Try posting it in the weekly threads to get reviewed or feel free to send me a PM
They're still hiring. Just full for scheduling interviews rn
Same situation here, but my recruiter told me something a bit different. At the time I had just gotten into project matching my recruiter said that many projects had not been approved yet, so there would be a bit of time before the process started rolling, after which most people will hear back within 6-8 weeks. She mentioned that she would update me when the process was starting to move along, and I haven't received any new updates yet, but it might be because she forgot.
Yes there are, had an on site recently in SF 
have a final round interview tmrw
Oh no. What year are you? I interviewed 3 days ago and my recruiter told me that they forwarded my application to SWE recruiters too (I'm a sophomore) today. I'd much prefer EP honestly and don't want to do another interview. Update us on how it goes?

Did they forward you because of your experience on your resume or your interview performance? I thought I did mediocre.
Super interested to learn more about your path to landing at Blue Sky Studios! DM'ed you
When did you hear back from Blizzard?
[deleted]
Dude I feel like you about Bloomberg! The manager screwed me over at my on-site by giving me a math problem like it wasn't even coding related like the answer was a math formula like wut
Dude I thought that senior manager round on onsite is just general behavioral talk and mostly guarantees an offer?? What questions did you get ask?
What type of school do you go to get an on campus interview? The one interview I had was through a Google doc and phone.


woah, did you have a lot of referrals or just an amazing resume?
[deleted]
I am pretty sure I solved every question ok in coding test. Rejected after 2 weeks.
Did u apply for the summer 19 position? If so maybe that had something to do with it?
I got a coding challenge and failed that. Freshman.
Same thing happened to me. Got the snapshot challenge for winter 2019, did it, thought I did well got rejection. Heard back from google about two weeks later saying that they've decided to reconsider and move me on but I have to reply by a certain date. Naturally, I don't use my gmail and wasn't expecting to hear back from google until the next recruiting cycle. By the time I saw that email and replied it was too late. Thought I'd shoot for Fall internship now, but did not even receive a snapshot, straight rejection. Very weird, even though now I have two more internships on my resume than I did the last time I applied and got the snapshot
Did you get the coding sample?
Yeah me too. Got an auto rejection. I have a couple interviews lined up at dotcoms so I'm not pure trash, maybe the bar is just high for G this year.
Yup same. Got a Google snapshot and then interview 8 months ago, but insta-rejected this time :(
Do you know if you can apply to more than one position? I would think you can but idk
Mozilla’s open source tools are really gaining traction, especially around data privacy since it’s becoming such a relevant topic these days. Would be pretty cool to work on one of those.
What were the phone interviews like for Apple following the on-campus?
Could we see your resume?
>it seems like Apple is not hiring many more interns for the rest of the semester

not true, I accepted my summer internship offer yesterday and my final round interview was just last week. Out of curiosity I asked my recruiter whether most intern slots were filled yet and he said that I got the last spot on my team but a lot of other teams are still doing interviews.
Everything between 1 hour to never
Within the same day to a month maybe

Great job! I don't think you're that lazy, do you think its too late to apply to those companies you listed? I haven't really been applying to many places, but am going to soon probably. 
Damn you have hella interviews, you have previous work experience?
See ya in Chicago! :) 
Ah the Twitter blackhole as they so call it
I hope Visa does not end up ghosting me.
>Continue this thread

When did you hear from MongoDB?
Did you end up completing roblox's last question? I can't for the life of me figure out what I did wrong, so even if you didn't complete it, can we talk over pm?
how many interviews did you have during superday? and what were they like? i have mine next week and im a little nervous :/
I got rejected the night you posted this comment.
[deleted]
I applied around August or September, did the OA about 2 weeks ago, and haven't heard anything since. My status says "Application Submitted"
I got my offer a few days ago (applied late September, interviewed early October).
Still waiting. Applied October 8th so I guess it’s expected
Nope and I applied like early August
I have my interview coming up soon. What aspect was challenging and any tips? Thanks! :) Btw i heard people who thought they did bad but then ended up getting offers anyways so don't be discouraged
You can learn hashmaps easily! My favorite data structure lol 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashmap-treemap-java/

Sorting, know the popular ones... Bubble (Easy), Merge (Medium), and Quick(Hard) in my opinion. YMMV.

Stacks and Queues,

From my own experience, many companies are understanding of your current academic progress (if you chose to put your courses on your resume/spoken to them about where you're at in school). So if they choose to interview you, they are aware that you haven't learned data structures and algorithms yet. An in-person/phone interview will most likely be a reflection of what you already know and perhaps push you to explore concepts you have yet to learn. That being said, it's always good to learn those concepts early in case interviewers do test you. But for the most part, don't sweat it! Good luck!
I completed the Hirevue a month ago and still no response.
They responded to you really quick( I think you mentioned your interview was 2 days ago) 

Best of luck!
They told you a concrete committee review date?

They said I was going to HC, but no mention of a date lol
Congratz on making HC. It kinda sucks that its a while from now though - prob because they are in peek recruiting time. I wonder how some people get accepted so quickly. Is there a chance some EP candidates bypass HC?
it's hard af, good luck
lol
Yes! Did you interview for EP and SWE? EP usually takes hella long like 2-3 weeks minimum
How were the HRT interviews? Did they ask you specific C++ questions or systems/low level questions? Did they only let you code in C++ during the phone interviews?
Curious as to why you decided to with them vs Google/FB?
Congratz! That's insane for a sophomore. What's ur past experience like?
It took me 2 weeks to get an HireVue after finishing the Hacker Rank. I think my application status changed, but I don't really remember. 
They probably already sent it
When did you apply & when did you receive the assessment ?
What types of questions were on the sample?
~2 weeks for me
One of my solutions was pretty unoptimized but I passed anyways.
Applied to two positions a few weeks ago and got a no for both last week (no rejection email, but the application is no longer in progress on their portal). Waiting to hear back on two more.
got the same email. Part 1 if I remember from last year is multiple choice questions and part 2 is a leetcode question. Final technical interview was a video interview leetcode medium. 
got OA a few months ago and just completed final round interview, PM me if u have any questions
Hey, congrats!! I actually applied, but haven't heard back yet :/ Do you mind telling me when you applied and if you are a sophomore or freshmen?
They should give you a slideshow with resources my dude. Leetcode is probs your best bet, or CTCI if you have time.
When did you apply for the internship and when did you get the assessment ?
Completed the final interview last week. I did python and it's a text editor. It looked like syntax and compilation wasn't really that important since I made a few mistakes and as I went to change then my interviewer said its OK and we should move onto the next question. I was given a LC easy/medium (more on the easy side) and a LC Hard (really fckn hard) 
When did you apply and when did you get the assessment?
I only got 3/7 on OA1 but feel like I did really well on the logic part. Somehow made it to OA2 but not sure how that will go 
Same except 3/7. The lowest I’ve seen anyone score and say they made it to next round is 4/7 but who knows! Guess we’ll find out in the next day or so. Good luck 
I got a 4/7 on the debugging a few weeks ago and was really confident on the logic and got rejected within 24 hours :(
Just wanted to share that the OA2 for me was a Hash-table problem and a difficult graph problem. I got the hash table correct but didn’t even know how to start the graph problem. They scheduled a virtual interview with me
>Yeah, it sounds like we're on about the same page with them. I don't really know what to expect with that response
I got the same one month back. 
Congrats on the success! What offer did you end up taking? 
Does the "Interviews" number include coding challenges?
Hey. What profile did you apply for with JP Morgan? I applied for Data Science & Machine Learning Internship back in late November and completed the HireVue. Still waiting to hear back from them.
How technical were the interviews in general? and did your qualifications matched up with the "requirements" of the ones you did get offers from?
Oh wow congrats! If it's not too much trouble do you have a anonymous resume? I'm a sophomore too and I'd like to see how someone that found success did it. Thank you! 
I don't need visa sponsorship but am close friends with people who do and have struggled with this as well. Both of the students I knew with this issue were probably overqualified, and defintely had a harder time searching then other similar students, which honestly really sucks. I know that they've had luck (offers/previous internships\] at Hulu, Bloomberg, Hershey, and Coursera, so maybe check those out if their recruitment hasn't ended. Best of luck!
It's hard but I finally got an offer after interviewing with like 5 companies 
Oscar health, pocket gems, salesforce, Dropbox, mcafee, nextdoor, lending home, udemy,codecademy. A ton of other smaller places too. Keep checking Glassdoor and LinkedIn.
Aim for smaller/local companies. Big names are pretty much done and T2 is a mix of being done and searching for their last spots.
I had a friend who did their assessment fall 2017 and also didn't pass both test cases. They says that if you get an interview that's when you can potentially impress them, and they ended up getting an offer!

&#x200B;

If you don't mind sharing, when did you do the assessment? And would you say the questions were very hard or did you just maybe make small mistakes that added up for time? I finished my assessment and I'm waiting for a response... I'm trying to approximate when I should hear back.

&#x200B;

edit: the reason why I ask about difficulty is because my friend I mentioned above told me their questions were super hard with dynamic programming and stuff, whereas I felt like my questions were relatively medium/manageable for someone of my skill, so I guess it might depend on Amazon's standards every season.
What type of topic I need to prepare for OA2? I am in the middle of DSA class and I don't know about graph or hash types yet
do u have the discord link?
Visa and Airbus both had me take that assessment. I think they ended up taking an hour each.

Was worth it, because I got an interview from both of them - but really it's shitty hiring practice. I left some very strong feedback on them. 
they gave you a crypto iq test.
Heard they pretty much stopped placing canadian interns in their Seattle office this year so congrats on that. Seattle > Canadian offices anyday
[deleted]
[deleted]
unrelated, but didn't you get an offer back from one of the companies you rejected? I read your Google update thread
bro that's rough
You've got this! As long as you put in the effort and study effectively you will nail your EP interviews :)
Sophomore as well! Hang in there! I'm pretty much banking on EP as well. 
Sophomore - at least you got EP! I haven't heard back.
I study at a Canadian uni and am neither Canadian nor American.

I have interned in the US before and will be doing so again this summer. What would you like to know?
Yes, I would also like to know.
>international

Foreign. The word is foreign.


Yeah their intern class must be ridiculously large. Though, not everyone who got the offer accepts it so you never know.
Yea , they are hiring like crazy ! They have also significantly reduced the hiring bar. I guess they are expanding rapidly .
I guess they hire around 1000 plus interns in Seattle itself, they have close to 20k plus software engineers in Seattle so that number is good
I've applied to all of those companies and have not heard back from any of them
My friend and I both just schedule phone interviews for mongodb
Had two phone interviews with Yext
I know Oath did on campus interviews. Haven't heard anything from the others, including one which I was referred to. 
Applied months ago, nothing besides mongoDB
how long did hubspot take to get back to you? i had a phone interview like, a month ago, and they never reached out w any more info??
[deleted]
If you havent figured it out yet, I took a look at the app, and it says

"include work, volunteer and project experience."

which I assume means to include any projects you've worked on?
Someone else correct me if I'm reading that wrong
me too... are we done now?
How many total applications? Feel free to post your resume so we can see if there's something else we can help you out with!
What? No way people are receiving offers unless google had their projects released quick ASF this semester.       
Unless you mean winter
Nothing much you can do it about it, but I wouldn't worry too much either. Last year I had friends receiving offers in Feb
Google has been backed-up a lot this year from what I'm hearing. I've applied > 4 weeks ago and still haven't heard back. You're not alone! As long as you didn't get a rejection email, you're still being considered. 
What are you applying for? SWE or EP intern?
I've talked to a recruiter and she said November.
Pretty sure like everyone's been curious about it. I'm betting January if at all, maybe they don't want people reneging or something? Hopefully..
Yes, no referral 
What do you want? I have a bunch of them
What's your strategy for this?
Just put what you want to work on. Almost every applicant is going to check off ML/AI/Vision/NLP (even with zero experience) so I wouldnt really bother unless you have actual experience and knowledge beyond taking an intro course. 
Hey, have you get matched now?
Congrats! Hey I was wondering how much time have you wait from passing hiring committee to getting matched?
I moved onto project matching and my recruiter never even told me I was being sent to HC, so it should be fine. I heard back 2 weeks after my interview
Wouldn't stress about it; there seems to be a lot of variability when it comes to their interview process. Getting passed onto the hiring committee doesn't even guarantee that you'll get into project matching.
takes more than two weeks more the decision
Same here. Are you EP or SWE? The best tip I have gotten is to interpret your anxiousness as excitement. Good luck!
Heard back after Karat interview in about a week. It's followed by 4 interviews with engineering managers/developers on the Citrix GoToMeeting platform. Received offer approximately 3 weeks after Karat interview.
I have an interview with them soon. How was the interview?
Just over a week. Last year I never heard back because I was rejected. I guess Google just ghosts their rejects now.
When did you complete your interviews? I am also waiting to hear back from them.
Somewhere between 1 in 5 and 1 in 7
"I would prefer to not disclose that information."
I've heard advice along the lines of saying that you have an nda/if you feel weird about that sign a nda with yourself. 
Hey, did you end up doing it? I just got the hackerrank and I'm also wondering what to expect.
Had my explore onsites last year (freshman year). If ur freshman, it's going to be less technical. But honestly, its a hit or miss - Ik people who had all 3 technicals and some all 3 behaviourals. Prepare for both and honestly the interviews for explore are much more conversational than normal interviews - even for technical interviews. Interviewers are likely going to spend more time talking about what's your passions, your past projects, technologies ur excited about, etc than in normal SWE intern interviews. Also, they might ask you some basic PM questions and basic testing questions like design a clock for the blind or smt.
Curious, which wave are you interviewing for? The interview dates are so spread out
Probably cause they have to screen people out since it was easy. So they get nit picky and start doing it off anything they can for the challenge, and resume.        
Curious how long it took for you to hear back post coding challenge though if you don't mind?
Haven't yet heard back after doing it
I have a midterm coming up soon that I haven't studied for.
What's better -- Skipping it and taking a 0 or taking it and perhaps getting lucky and passing it?
If you skip it you have 0 chance of proceeding forward. If you do it and fail it, you learn, you practice and if if you manage to not fail it can proceed forward. There is no benefit from skipping a challenge.
Nope, but i remember someone saying that Spotify will be like January
still waiting to hear from twitch
I've gone through two phone interviews! The initial one was just basic behavioral questions and going over your resume, nothing too difficult technically. The second phone interview was just with a team specific recruiter, but just basic behavioral questions and going over your resume again. I'm still waiting on an interview with a specific team. It's a very lax phone interview, just don't be too nervous and talk to your recruiter like a human!!
My sister received an offer a month or so ago 
I'm waiting on them as well. I had a pretty solid interview, but I haven't heard anything back.
You've heard back?
How was OA2? Can you give an idea of what to expect?
How did your interview go after? What kind of stuff did they ask?
If you check out previous intern salary threads I think its like 7k Canadian per month + separate housing stipend
In the same position with Dallas. Sent an email to the HR who did my phone interview but didn’t get a response back :(
Applied last Tuesday. Got a quick rejection to their big-data internship, but nothing yet for the Software Engineering one.
I got a SWE intern offer for their CO location about 2 weeks ago
That’s a pretty amazing season for a Sophomore! Best of luck at Microsoft! Did you ever consider moving Amazon to fall semester?
[deleted]
How were you able to get so many online assessments? 
pretty sure the waiting period for most companies only applies if you’re trying to apply to the same position again. So you should be fine
Just log into jobvite and check your app status there. Mine still says new 
Is it the one in Mahwah, NJ? How did it go? I'm supposed to talk to them this week.
I haven't yet, this was for the Battle.Net position. 

I didn't have time for one of the code problems and another I was kicking myself for using a type that was too few bytes long to hold the full number so I only passed the first 3 test cases. I left a little note about it in the few seconds I had left but I'm guessing there's a hard limit as to how many points you need to get to pass.
Same boat as you, fingers crossed about some sort of response. 
If you only got 1, then the chances that you are gonna move on are almost nonexistent.. sorry
Yeah I did it yesterday, and the time was the only problem. Could only solve 3 problems and read only 4. Not sure what will happen. Best luck
I had the same experience. I got maybe 3/7. I barely had time to read the question before I had to move on to the next one. 
I think they extended offers like months ago
Friend said the interview was the hardest he's ever done and was super low-level. The offer is crazy though, like ~11k+ / mo + housing.
When did you have your 1st interview with Akuna?
I personally no as I failed all the technical interviews from the big companies that sponsor but one of my friends got like 7 offers for an internship in the US (SF, NYC, SEATTLE)
Friends of mine who needed HB1s have been sponsored by Hershey, Coursea, Bloomberg, and Hulu. 
A freshman British classmate of mine got a Bloomberg internship.
OA1 is 7 debugging and 24 logic questions. Pretty easy
OA2 is 2 LC easy-med coding questions
Congrats! Are you going to Amazon for data science or SWE?
Do you know if people with referrals can circumvent the online assessments?
Did you get the two 45 minutes interviews as final step? What kind of questions did they asked? Do I need to prepare stories when I have failed, and succeed etc.?
how did you get placed om aws?
Cool, you got your team already......I just got a form to fill three preferences and that offer will arrive tomorrow
PM'd!
Congrats :) Did you end up getting the Asana offer or Amazon? 
pm'd!!!

UPDATE: got an email today with a rejection. 

&#x200B;

Good luck to you guys, seems the hiring spree slowed down 
You needn't worry about the behavioural interview. From what Ive read, not all interviews include this part. It's just perfunctory for internship.  
Also, I'm curious, most people got 2 questions(Array, Tree/Graph). What question did you get?
When did you get your confirmation for the interview?  
Like me, a lot of people still haven't got their time slot for the interview.
>totheneongodtheymade

I applied to that role got rejected, lol. If I may ask what's your background.
I've heard of people listing positions like: "Incoming SDE Intern, starting May 2019" or something similar.
did you apply to JPM through their career portal? I've applied through their career page and never heard back after a hirevue.
I applied online and did the Hirevue. My next round was a couple weeks after when they came to my school to do on-campus interviews, so if you're at a relatively large school that's what might end up happening.
Don't lie to them. If you don't have an offer deadline, don't tell them that you do. Which Big 4's are you interviewing with?

Look up the infamous story of Jeffrey Chiang. He falsely told Morgan Stanley that he got an offer deadline from Bank of America. His MS recruiter called up a friend at BoA and found out that he lied. His name is supposedly blacklisted from all of the major finance companies.
Just google local companies and email them asking about positions. Also look at github.com/christine-hu/summer-2019-internships
Their technical screen is hard

Could you tell us where in Europe?
You were a junior last year. Are these for full-time?

This is the internship thread.
I'm guessing you must go to a target school? I don't think Snap even lets you apply online for internships
Would you mind sharing your past experience?
How much does Chick pay for their internships lol?

&#x200B;
Hey, poiuyt78292, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Yeah I got this about a month ago. Haven't heard back since 
How long after submitting your video did Verizon take to send you this message? 
Leetcode and behavioural
Yo I just got the email for on site! 
>SimpleDescription9

How was the phone interview like ?
Sounds like a queueing problem. Eg round robin, shortest job first, etc 
That greedy algo tho
Wanna do it on Pramp?
I heard back from EP today (10/24) to schedule interviews. I applied 9/25 and I am a sophomore white male from a "top" 200 CS program. 

Don't lose hope if you haven't been rejected yet! I think my "diversity" part was what set me apart-- that I'm from a rural community (sold it better in the essay than this comment lol). Good luck!
I applied to EP same time. I heard back mid October and my interview is scheduled for 2 weeks from now. (Asian male from Canada)
I applied to EP around September 20 and was contacted for an interview several days later, interviewed in early October, and received an offer several days ago (mixed race female at a top 20-ish (?) CS program).

Some of my friends haven't heard back yet, but I think they applied later in September/October. 

Good luck with the whole process!  
CTCI + LeetCode easy.
Good luck buddy :) ! Interviewing for EP as well in 2 weeks. From Canada
Ask if you can do a virtual on-site. I'm currently studying abroad in Europe and I've done that for a number of American companies (or flew to their offices in London).
They will send you an email telling you to check their application portal for an update. Also 2 weeks is nothing for goldman sachs, I waited around 6 weeks after completing hirevue to get a rejection
Did you get the hacker rank from Goldman Sachs?
Most people get either one easy/medium leetcode with a follow up question or 2 leetcode easy's or if you're an unlucky mofo like me, one easy leetcode with a followup and one leetcode hard.
Your recruiter should give you the details, it's a mix of behavioral and technical and one where you go in-depth on a past project. 
I had two technical sessions, one engineering manager interview, and then a lunch interview (I was a bit surprised, but they do pay attention to this!). No bug-hunting interview for interns. Make sure you're comfortable in whatever environment you choose to interview in and be ready to google/read documentation on the spot!
After having my phone interview, it took them 3 weeks to get back to me (today). Good luck!
As a freshman it's extremely unlikely you'll get anything unless you have prior experience or connections. Microsoft and  Google do have programs targeted towards freshmen though.
Is this for Goldman Sachs Software Engineering Internship? I couldn't find openings on their website. Can you please let me know if there is one available?
I got an offer on monday from my onsite on the same day as you
I haven't even gotten the OA yet... :/
Heard from Twilio for a hackerrank a month after applying. Heard Twilio is pretty slow right now so prepare to wait a couple week from other comments
I did two interviews with Twilio, didn’t hear back for about 3 weeks after the second one, so I emailed my recruiter because I had another offer. He never got back to me ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
It's been 6 weeks since I did twilio's hackerrank. Never heard back
[deleted]
There is a variance in difficulty, some mediums are a lot more intuitive to me than easies. What I like to do is start out with a really basic case and think of my approach, then make the input a little more complicated and see how my algorithm does, and keep going from there (once I’m happy with my algorithm I try corner cases). If I see it’s horribly inefficient then I start to think about patterns I see in the data or information I’m not using that could make my code faster. But honestly, practice makes perfect and leetcode questions don’t come easily to most of us, so just keep at it and you’ll start to see commonalities between the questions themselves, which will help you solve them!
say your thought process out loud or write ideas down. If it takes too long, look at answers and understand the thought process behind them. Reading EPI and doing the problems have also helped me a lot.
I got an offer from them and they told me I wouldn’t hear back for a couple weeks after and I think it was just over a month when they gave me the offer. Just email your recruiter and ask what’s going on. But my one piece of advice would be to not do that until you’re ready to accept an offer, since their standard policy is to give you a week to decide once they’ve given the offer.
which one did you apply for? Can I get link
Not even a single interview :(
I'm still anxiously waiting to hear back. It kind of sucks because you can't be in the applicant pool for the summer and winter SWE stuff at the same time so you're really SOL if you don't get winter and then are too late for summer.
just got a request for an additional interview... depressing
I got two without "insider" but I'm a returning intern.
what was the interview process like for bridgewater?
Congrats on all the offers! But how was your interview process for PwC? I applied online couple weeks ago and haven't heard back lol
What's the checkr onsite like? it sounds kinda daunting
Host matching started last Wednesday-ish, but I don't think the majority of summer projects will be approved until mid-November (is what my recruiter said a few weeks ago). Don't overthink it, I've heard of people joining the pool in January and still getting matched!
how was it?
Dunder Mifflin Sabre????
In the same boat. I emailed a week and a half ago and no response
where'd you apply for the AI program?

Spotify hasn't even started reviewing applications
I've definitely seen people get offers from Uber, Pinterest, and Apple and maybe Twitch.
Snap has internship applications open?
It's definitely late in the cycle for top companies, but applying now is better than absolutely nothing - after all, if you don't apply at all you have a 0% chance. There's nothing to lose by applying to as many postings as you can.
I have challenge 4 if anyone wants to chime in
lc med
When did you apply dude ?
There's always the fear that everything will fill up, but afaik they are still interviewing/hiring sophomores in full swing. Maybe your hiring committee date will be rushed?
Nope i applied long back and didnt get hackerank . so i guess they resume screen before sending oa . all the best dude !
What position did it send you? I applied as backend software engineer intern and they sent me a hackerrank for test engineer. I was wondering if they did something similar to you.
Hey, I got a hackerrank too and completed it, it was very easy......did u get a response after that
yep it was about time 
Technical or behavioral?


I did a month or two ago. 2 leetcodes questions (can't remember if it's hard or not), plus one question that makes you code up a simple website (basically test on if you know how to manipulate DOM) .
Codepair for me was implement a string class, I wouldn’t be surprised if they made you implement a data structure.

After that it’s final round video interview, 30 min technical on OS concepts, 30 min behavioral.
Same here, over 300. 
Around 350. Don't give up! I applied to the company that I interned for last Summer in December, interviewed with them in January, and got a decent offer in February. I was so ready to give up but getting the offer and the experience itself made it all worth it.
Sent 32, insta-reject from 6, first round interviewed with 6, 2nd/3rd round interview from 3, offer from 1, still have interview with another one, withdrew from my third one due to time constraint with the offer, haven't heard back from anyone else.
When I was in college, I sent about \~70 each year, interviewed at \~10, offer \~2.
About 200. Just got an offer a month ago.
120, only heard back from 1
2
Yes, worth emailing. Recruiters are aware of these situations and are usually able/willing to help.
i had 5/7 debugging and went through
I’ve heard 5/7 - 7/7 is a yes, but 5/7-6/7 isn’t automatic yes. Not sure tbh, just basing on previous redditors. I’m about to do my OA1 tmrw, do you have any tips you could PM me?
Pretty sure I got 4/7 and I got the second part today 
[deleted]
Did it like a week ago. 6/7 behavioral questions each around 3-4 mins 
Last year I didn’t hear back until mid March and then when I got rejected they said I had made the top 20% of candidates, so I’m sure they’re still looking at candidates if they gave me high consideration for that long without rejecting me. Hang in there!
No one has heard anything positive, just rejections,  so keep your hopes up. 
It’s a bit empty 
[deleted]
FWIW I passed ~90% (fucked up on one test case that I couldn't see, I had extra time left but was just was annoyed because the platform kept freezing and disconnecting so I just closed out of it) and got an email that morning at ~4am saying I was rejected (I'm guessing it was automated because otherwise wtf?).
I passed all in both questions
Did you apply to both the Summer Internship and the Future Engineers? Because one of the emails could have been for one of those.
You made it to part 2. 5/7 is good enough to proceed don't worry. Good luck for part 2 now!
Can you give me any idea of what to expect for the debugging questions? Take my first one ever this week for Amazon.
[deleted]
Two of my friends heard from Amazon, one week after the interview, both of them got the offer. I think they'll let you know even if you are rejected. What are the type of questions one can expect in virtual interview? Any language related questions? Are we free to use any language?
How long after OA2 did you hear back to schedule the interview? What did you get on OA2?
Thanks for the replies. I just received an offer and so much stress as been lifted off my shoulders :)
can you give me some insight on what the interview was like? and what questions they asked
2 days and an offer
How was OA1? I have to complete it by Tuesday.
I got a leet code medium (basic list/hashmap stuff) and a leet code medium/hard that had to do with graph theory. Good luck!
They say you can use any language but I've heard some interviewers force c/c++/java. My interviewer let me use anything
I think technically you can only use C/C++/Java but you can ask your interviewer and if they are comfortable with it then you can use Python.
Just completed mine! Was hella difficult
I got one like 2 weeks ago but didn’t do it, not too late I bet. 
My interview was on 15th. still waiting for the decision.
PM'D!
Did they only ask coding questions?
hi! what difficulty would you say the Q would be on leetcode?
I didn't pass all test cases for my second problem on OA2, but it compiled. I got the first question 12/12. On OA1 I got 6/7 with 11/12 test cases. It's been four days and I hear they give rejections pretty early. Am I safe?
That sucks man. You got any tips for the Google Project Match? I've been stuck in it for weeks and had heard nothing from any PM's. I've changed my questionnaire answers a dozen times but still nothing and the recruiter can't tell you anything about project availability so...
[deleted]
How'd you find Two Sigma's on-sites? Was it harder than Big 4 or about the same?
Wow, good for you. How many of these were via referrals?
any significant resume rejections?
When did you apply to STEP?
Tell them about your offer deadlines and you'll hear back much faster. After I told them about my deadline, I heard after 4 days 
What made you think it went well?
Strictly speaking, you can't move your start date, but what you can do is interview now and then withdraw your summer application. Google keeps your results around for 1 year, so you'd be able to skip interviewing and go straight into host matching when the fall applications open (should be March-April).

I'd suggest doing the interviews now if you feel ready. Wait til spring if you want more time to prepare.
I’d recommend reaching out for your hr and asking him/her about how to improve your questionnaire.  These tips helped me greatly and brought me to two IPIs almost in no time.
Hi! I'm in the host matching phase for Google's Technical Program Manager intern position and had my first interview last week and still waiting to hear back. I've heard it usually take around 1-2 months though, so definitely plenty of time
I wouldn't say that's a poor recruiting season lol. Mongo and LinkedIn are great companies, congrats.
Which offer are you taking?
just wondering if you're really considering the other companies over your Google return offer? i'm kind of in the same situation with a return offer from a big4, but i'm interviewing at other smaller companies for practice
Would you mind sharing a bit about your background (like past experience/year)?
Hey, congrats on the Hirevue invite (I got one as well)! I'm not sure if I'm recalling this correctly but I think there were several open dates to start the internship program. I would just do the Hirevue as normal, and if you proceed, just make sure to mention it to your recruiter! Good luck, hopefully you get it!
Exact same situation with me (same classes) except with Amazon, not Google. I have no advice but I wish you luck!
Congrats man that's a big accomplishment!! Get on that CTCI and Leetcode grind!
I haven’t taken data structures or algorithms yet lol, you’ll be fine just read up on CTCI and do some leetcode 
Lol I was in the same exact boat this semester with a google, but I havent finished my intro 2 class or taken discrete. Its gonna be tough but a huge accomplishment! Congrats!
Has anyone gotten contacted for Amazon Future Engineer yet? I was wondering when they are going to start contacting people.
Just took it. It had 3 questions: 2D array parsing, String parsing/anagrams, cost to build tree given int array


First one was easy. Second one took some time, managed to get 8/10 test cases with the last two failing due to timeout :/. Didn't even attempt the third lol.

Edit: this was for softheon 
did the lendinghome hackerrank nearly 2 months ago . No response after that!
I did lendinghome and got an interview. I thought I did really well on the interview and they decided to move on to other candidates
Haven't heard back either. They probably got a ton of applications and it's just taking them longer to get through them.
I've only heard about people getting rejected, even those who applied right before the deadline, but haven't heard of any acceptances/interview calls yet. do post here if anyone hears/hears of anyone who got an interview.
I know people who have been declined. Everyone else I know that applied, hasn't heard back yet
I got an email about continued interest/confirming info around 3 days ago, and yesterday got an email about scheduling an interview. My friend who did it last year (as a frosh) had her interview in \~late Feb, so I think they're going through sophomores first then frosh ??
applied to Google EMEA with referral 5 min ago. will see... keep me updated and I will keep you. k? 
I finished it a few days ago
Did it
A-Ok
I've talked with a few people, and myself included Google has been slow to respond to emails this year. They have been responding, but a week in between seems average
Shoot an email
I would email your recruiter, everyone has been saying Google is slow to reply so maybe I'm an outlier here but my recruiter was very responsive and got back to my emails within hours so I would definitely check in. It wouldn't hurt anything. 
Applied sept 21st, heard back oct 9th
I applied in late September and was contacted within a few days to schedule my interview, got an offer a few days ago
2 phone interviews for me
One to two 
Have my first interview with them in a few weeks. Pretty excited. 
Even with three pending offers all due in like a week (first on 10/30) it took me about two weeks from my interview. I heard back today that I am moving to project matching.
Can be onto HC and the recruiter didn't notify you. Aka be ready for 2more weeks ish
I interviewed for the EP a couple weeks ago and got an email probably a day later saying I was being moved to the hiring committee. I had a competing offer and still it took them several weeks to get my decision, but I finally got my offer a couple days ago. 
Over two weeks and I have not heard a single word yet. It may take a while, so hang on.
I'm in the exact same boat -- had mine on thursday as well.  
They're just probably swamped with peak hiring atm
Wait until monday and then email the recruiter 
Last year, I heard back from google 2 weeks after the phone interviews. Then got into host matching.
How were your interviews?
I had a friend do it - she said it was very easy. Best of luck!
Hey did you hear back yet? :O
I got an invitation for a hirevue from them, decided to take it while i was high af, and immediately withdrew my app the next day.
Nope applied like a solid month ago 
Third interviews means they didn't do that great in one of them. Good chance you did well enough to move on to getting an offer, which will take more than two weeks.. Take this with a grain of salt though.
Is this for swe intern
Got a rejection from FBU last week, which is weird because a friend told me they weren’t rolling.
Snap's been interviewing interns since September, but they don't post internship apps, you need a referral or go to one of their target schools and "apply" in person. 

I think Tinder is similar but I can't remember what I've heard.

I haven't heard anything about Spotify either :( 
[deleted]
this thread, mrshibe.me, linkedin, and there was a github repo with a lot of internships
Pm me
Can PM me too
Someone lmk how to do it pls, I was thinking a bidirectional graph algo, how bout yall?
What was the question again? I recall the second one for me being the hardest because of the runtime requirements. 
If they're on the fence you might get asked for a third. 
You can never know. I had 2 great interviews with G and didn't make it to Host Matching :(
PM me 
I heard back from LendingHome for a phone interview about a month after their challenge.
[deleted]
Probably Dropbox, just from the quality of engineering, although you probably can't go wrong with either one.
I think you're good dude, I was only able to solve one question and ended up rejected 
Yea i got it. 

HAve you started yours yet?
Niantic was leetcode easier than easy.
Ghosted after technical screen for Coinbase
100% accept it.
easy, solved it in 5 minutes
[deleted]
I got rejected from one position and got a "2-5 hour long" take home exercise for another position, that I probably would've done except that the system was buggy (didn't grant me access correctly, was missing instructions, etc) and I have an offer/am exhausted from recruiting 
Got rejected, does that count? 
Going through it now, have my 3rd and final interview Monday. From what I’ve seen the process is pretty team specific, but let me know if you have any questions!
Interned there last year. The interviews were fairly easy, more situational than leetcode and usually involved 3 or so parts increasing in difficulty. 
I interned there last summer, it's a mix of behavioral and technical (coderpad-like) questions! Feel free to PM me
I read somewhere that everybody gets OA1 & OA2 . Is it not true ?
Yes, it's fairly easy and only took around 10 minutes. Don't stress about it!
Yeah, I did that 2 weeks ago, it was easy
I too received it half n hour ago without getting an OA. Is there no way to re-apply without waiting for next 6 months?
Had an interview last year w/ them & they asked me a well-known recursive algorithm + big O notation stuff for the first phone screen.  
Then it was a take home test -> onsite after but I canceled it.  

I'd suggest you ask about their tech stack -- it's proprietary and the interviewer gave me a lot of red flags about the company in general.
following
I heard back around 2-3 weeks ago. I applied probably 3 days after it opened
I would like to expand to this with: have any CANADIAN FRESHMEN applying to the KITCHENER position heard back from EP? 
Not me personally, but a friend of mine got an interview.
I got rejected even though I passed all 
It’s not too hard tbh but I heard they cancelled their program, both I and my friend that got the quiz got ghosted. 
One of my friends got an offer about 2 months ago
Not sure about whether they’ve sent out offers, but a couple friends working there have said they’re oversubscribed with returners, so the amount of new interns they’re taking is very limited.
I've heard that it is entirely technical in nature, so no behavioral questions. Word on the thread is that the questions are also in the LC easy range
I am on doing my second technical interview . how should i prepare and what kind of questions did they ask you ?
I did it a few weeks ago. Purely technical. A LC easy/medium and a LC Hard. 
Regular behavorial 
I don’t think it’s worth reneging ok Facebook for confluent. Not only are you damaging your rep with a huge company like Facebook but FB’s name will take you further than confluent.

I also interviewed with confluent so I see how attractive it could be. Try moving Facebook but ultimately if you can’t, i don’t think it’s worth it. Confluent is growing really fast and you’ll have no problem getting an interview if you wanna switch. 

Also it’s their first official internship class so it could go either way tbvh. 
Try to see if u can move fb to Fall 2019
Im about to go through the Facebook SWE interview process, do you have any tips or advice you can give me, please?
Went through this last year. I got asked a few questions about stuff on my resume, and the technical questions were LC easy.
I got the same one! While I don't have much info to give to you (yet) I wish you the best of luck!
i finished my final technical interview. be able to explain one of your projects and know big o notation. 
Is this for amazon canada? Also r u sophomore by any chance
I got an offer from AT&T TDP in january. 

My process was behavioral phone interview -> online assessment -> final interview.

The online assessment this will mostly be OOP questions and a leetcode easy like reversing a string). Final interview was 2 leetcode easy with a question about bfs dfs space complexity.

I also took the online assessment and it seems like for me (and a few others on this sub) got an email saying we're still under consideration after taking the assessment and we heard nothing back ever since. I took the assessment prob around Nov/Dec, it was so long ago I couldn't remember how difficult it was, but I don't think it should be anything you worry about.
I just got a video interview mind telling me about the process?
How did your interview go?
Cant remember exactly but think they said a 2 week turnaround time from the first phone call
They responded to me like 4 days after I did it.
I finished OA2 on 1/22, my deadline was 1/31. I heard back 2/18 that I’m moving on to 1 virtual interview. I have it this Thursday 2/28
Took me 1.5 weeks
if i got oa1- 4/7 debugging, 24/24 logic and oa2 didn't pass any test cases but pretty much finished q1 and wrote a good amount of code/pseudocode for q2, do i have any chance of getting an interview?
Just got an invite for a virtual interview
Nothing "weird" or niche, but you need to be familiar with the common STL structures. unordered-map, set, map, unordered-set, vector, stack, queue, etc.
Went through a On Demand with them have a technical interview this week
\+1 interview this week as well. Anyone have any advice or info to offer?

Edit: Completed the interview and received an offer. PM me if you need info!
got an email the day after saying I moved on.
I still have to do this. Is it hard ? How do I prepare ?
How difficult was the 70 minute technical assessment? And were you able to pass all test cases? 
Easy to medium technical questions for me and focus on the leadership principles and you will be fine
>How long after OA2 did you hear back to schedule the interview? What did you get on OA2?

&#x200B;
[deleted]
Three of my friends got an offer in the past couple of weeks. While the questions you'll be asked might depend on your interviewer, all my friends were asked LC easy-med questions. One of them was asked about his previous work experiences and some built-in data structures of Java. All their interviews went easy and got their offers within 4-5 days. Has Amazon's always been this simple?
I did mine on Feb 26th and still have no news. I think you usually hear back after 2-2.5 weeks
I got one as well, does anyone know if getting the questionnaire means that we cleared the coding challenge and will likely move to the interview stage ?
How was the coding challenge?
yeah, i got the coding challenge two weeks ago, but still no questionnaire.
same here, and my friend is in the same situation as well. Taken around March 5 or 6 
Heads up, it seems like the interview requests go out in waves, based on the week of your deadline. I know of 3 people (including me) that have gotten the interview invite within the same 2 hours. We took OA2 around March 1 and all got the interview invite on March 22
Is this for Fall or Summer?
I finished OA2 on March 7th and mine also updated to "Under Consideration" on the 21st.
Finished OA2 around March 4th, just got the amazon email for virtual interview. Did anyone get a confirmation after filling the form with your time slots?
What was before 21st?
You just gotta do it man. It's not a pleasant conversation but I'm sure your co-workers will 1000% understand. There is just no going around that conversation.
Did you do your interviews already?
Yes, you can. All of my friends (except 1) were allowed to use Python too. The one friend was unlucky and the interviewer didn't allow Python 
Yeah, my interviewer let me use python. The email confirming it said you can use any language you wanted though.
How long did you wait after your OA2?
Still waiting. I had mine on wednesday.
Mine was Tuesday - still waiting :(
def keep applying, but I might wait until january for spring recruiting 
I got one sometime past March last year, you’re fine.
Chances are, you missed it. Still apply though, but don’t get your hopes up. Big or small, spots fill up very fast. Next time, start applying like ASAP (August or September at the latest). 
Implementing a hashmap is fair game. It's considered a LC med.
I think leetcode mediums are a good bet. The actual questions depend on there interviewer more than it depends on the company. There's no set of questions that Google asks from. Practice how to think. Make a list of all the techniques you use to solve questions for example having double pointers or hashing everything into a set to make lookup O(1) or modifying the input DS to make your answer O(1) space. All the best! 
google interviews are mostly medium-hard leetcode problems 
I don't think they will ask you to implement a data structure - atleast not in code. If that was the main question they give, it would be a waste a time for them since it doesn't entail much problem solving. They will ask leetcode CTCI style questions. However, you SHOULD know how data structures are implemented, at least from a high level. For example, example they probably won't ask you how to implement a HashMap but if you end up using a HashMap to solve a problem then you should know the time complexity, what happens if there are hashing collisions, etc. 
Do you have any interest in product management? If not, I'd go with EP... I've also heard that EP is generally closer to a real SWE internship than Explore, in terms of the projects you do 
Hey, congrats on your offer! Can you give an estimate as to how long it took for you to get an offer after your phone interviews?
Google EP is closer to SWE and in my opinion, when you convert to actual SWE internship for the next summer, Google > Microsoft.
Got referred a month ago haven't heard anything.
What school?
Congrats, those are great offers. I'm surprised you only submitted 20 applications though.
Nope
The questions itself weren't hard but I struggled due to the time constraint
I got a DP question so it's possible you'll be asked 
How long did it take for you to get a response after finishing OA2?
After you filled out the interview timeslot survey, do you remember how long it took them to get back to you?
Can you PM the link too. I got into the host matching phase almost a month back and haven't received any interview requests yet :( Thanks!
Can you PM me the link too? I am also currently in the host matching phase. Thanks!
Yeah, they have been ghosting me for 3 months or smth.
this year it started in end of July/early August
Why didn’t you accept Poshmark or LendingHome?
Seriously what did you do to be able to get your feet in the door with so many companies?
don't understand why you are so downvoted
where'll you be heading?
I’ve emailed like 20 and got interviews for 10+ or so, I can send you the email I use. Might be your resume though.
I emailed about 20 and only got 1 response but it ended up turning into an interview with a top company so don't give up yet. Just be sure to keep it extremely brief and attach your resume. 
I think it matters to an extent. I know school name matters to get past the initial screening or to get an interview. Also campus recruiting and career fairs are also another added bonus imo but that is only if you take advantage of the opportunity. 
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
Have you not had success with school job fairs, internal job boards, or networking opportunities? I feel like that helps much more than a school name on a resume. 
I think the difference is that good schools give you more opportunities to get your foot in the door. Nobody is going to hire you solely because you went to a good school, but that doesn't mean going to a good school is worthless.
Fall internships: companies are unlikely to have specific postings for that period. Apply to their regular summer internships, get the offer, ask for it to be moved. 
I just google.
I think those only apply for host matching interviews i.e. shouldn't effect the interviews before hiring committee.
I did it a month ago, and passed the hirevue.  
If yours will be the same, then it should all be behavioral questions. As I have said to another comment on this thread, answer according to common sense and you should be fine.  
Please feel free to ask anything else, I'll try to get back as soon as possible.
I completed mine previous Sunday. Feel free to contact me.
It's gonna be all behavioral. Expect it to be awkward, but also expect them to account for how awkward it is.
I've done one last year. It's behavioural but it's awkward speaking to a camera so practicing recording yourself beforehand is a good idea. Questions reflect the company values that you can find on their website. 
Don't, use Python or some language with a library to do it.
If you want to use C++, you can use getline, stringstreams, and ' ' as the delimiter.

Ex: getline(stream,string,' ');

&#x200B;
IIRC Facebook doesn't send out email confirmations, I've also dug through my inbox in the past trying to find them
Just got rejected a few minutes ago, hope everything goes well for you bro! 
Ok, yeah, glad I'm not the only one who thinks this is a bit weird. I'm paranoid I didn't fully submit the app or something despite the fact I know I did, I don't get why they don't send confirmation.
Would like to know as well
I did it in October and I got no response from them lmao. Their process is weird. Some people got responses within a week, and some like me got no response even after so many months. If it takes more than a month then it's best to forget it. They are most probably done hiring by now.
got a reply a week later that I did not qualify, so maybe you are still in the running for a spot if you didn't get a rejection
I took it months ago, never heard back
Took it 1.5 months ago and just got a response in the form of a reject, they have filled apparently
I interned there! interview process is really easy and pretty much only behavioral unless your manager wants to give you technical questions, but I doubt it. But your experience is really team dependent and you have to do an annoying project with other interns outside of engineering. Pay is not very good for SWE, but it was better than working retail.

WFH culture is huge within engineering at Aetna (at least it was on my team), so that means you may not be in the same location as most of your teammates. I highly recommend being in any office but the headquarters (unless that’s your thing) because you have to semi dress up and theres barely any engineers at the HQ. I got ownership of my own project while I was there and it was a good experience, I just wish I wasn’t working in the HQ. they were really nice about that tho, and they flew me to Denver for a week to meet my team during their onsite. 
I put in an application a couple days ago, thats about it.
Leetcode Easy/Medium
[deleted]
Can't say, many people have completed both questions but if you did well on OA1, you may have a chance
The pattern problems are not that hard, I wouldn't expect to finish. I made it through a lot of them I think and got the next round. 
Usually the same as the first 
Same!! Which location is your top choice?
I saw a lot of kids saying they got the hackerrank recently so I guess not. 
No, I had an interview today with Dropbox, or at least I was supposed to :,( 
Nope, not everyone. 
[removed]
Yes, you can use python
I had a phone interview with Bloomberg last week. The interviewer called me late, and I totally bombed the technical part. It was not a pleasant experience because the interviewer made me feel  stupid by keeping sighing 
They are still open. I interviewed with them in April last year so don't give up yet.
you know if their 3.50 gpa requirement is a hard req?
I've had my technical phone interview with Google already. Your experience will probably depend on the interviewer, but for the most part it was a pretty standard technical interview. I just got a coding challenge, which I coded up a solution for while explaining my thought process, and the interviewer would occasionally give me hints towards a better approach. I would say to just make sure you're solid on data structures/algorithms fundamentals and you should be fine.
I did mine in the middle of last week.  Still waiting to hear back too.
you ever hear back?
Same I just got that email from UA and idrk what to expect lol. Also when did you apply to Verizon? 
Non algorithmic, mostly about building something with your interviewer. Was a lot of fun for me. 
Is this the phone interview or the coding challenge?
Depends. If you really thought the company would fill it's positions then yeah, but otherwise I don't think so. At least unless it's an absurdly long time
All behavioral
if it's the first one you're gonna have to do a self-recording with a mic and camera
My experience with Salesforce last year was just two one-hour hangouts where we talked about my past experience and worked through several leetcode medium-tier problems. I didn't really have to code out a solid solution for any of them, but just talking about solution structures, complexities, tradeoffs, etc.

I ask a lot about their team and the problems they're working on though, so we had a lot of great back-and-forth discussion. My scenario was kinda special cause I was being considered by a team after another intern reneged late in the year, so YMMV.
following
Facebook and Amazon have scheduled interviews with me. Nothing from Twitter after coding challenge, but they do this every year where they send the challenge out to everyone and interview like 20 people. Didn't even bother completing all the test cases for Twitter, not worth the time.
Did you check your amazon dashboard for status?
Have an interview with FB this week. No news from Twitter
Twitter is notorious for ghosting candidates, so I suggest that you don't stress too much about not getting a response from them.
Did hackerrank 2 weeks ago, no response. Emailed them yesterday.
my morgan stanley final round was super easy, behavioural and then a design question and a string manipulation question
An onsite for Barclays?  What role is this for?
Can you tell your experience about the tech rounds?
Mozilla, Salesforce, Yelp and Intuit are solid imo. Everything there is great though
They scheduled a behavioral interview with me a couple weeks ago.
5 weeks ago wow, did you try emailing the recruiter?
when is ur interview? I have one next week onsite
A 2-hour technical interview (very practical which I liked)  
and a standard behavioral  
Enjoyable overall
Took me a week to get Hirevue
A week for me
Nope
Wouldn't hurt to send a follow up email.

How was your interview?
[deleted]
Where did you apply for audible specifically?
Not sure what you expected, I think tons of people did so. So they had to filter other ways
Quora >= Dropbox > FB > Pinterest
FB for name recognition, Quora for best quality of engineers
Yelp
A couple days. I ended up passing the phone screen, but they said they were backed up for on-sites until late November (this was in mid-October).
Nope
I did!
look up on glassdoor - i know their interns get 10k/m
LC hard but doable in the time allotted.
If company B gives you an offer, you can decline. If company B requests subsequent interview rounds, you can decline those too. I’d just wait for them to make a move. No need to rush things.
How was the Hackerrank? 
Definitely do the top problems on leetcode for them, I got two of the top 5 for my interviews.
They took a weeks time in my case!
Mine took a day this year but about 2 weeks last year
not me
What is OA?
got one even though i was rejected on amazon.jobs
Is this for Amazon Canada or US sde intern?
Mine were all behavioral questions, in case you were wondering. It wasn't super hard, as long as you answer according to common sense it should be alright.
I can help you with it. 
When did you complete your Hackerrank ?
Just got rejected lol Freshman URM. I actually got rejected a day before apps closed.
Right on the same boat with you bud. Good luck to both of us! 
When I submitted mine, it just said if I don't hear anything by late December, I definitely am not in the running.
Hey bro I got rejected a few minutes ago, hope everything goes well for you! 
Yep, its easy I'd say!
It was okay. Doable. Kind of like leetcode easy-mediumish. Not too easy or too hard.
def leetcode easy imo
I sure hope so
Easy
Was pretty easy imo
Around a week and a half
It was hard but you don’t need to finish all of them to pass
your offer can be rescinded bc of gpa, so write a good excuse lol
http://fortune.com/2014/10/21/at-a-job-interview-how-do-you-explain-a-low-gpa/
No different than someone who graduates in May
I’m graduating this December and it had no effect on my internship offers, if anything if you accept a full time offer after then they’ll be willing to let you start over the summer with the spring graduates which gives you a bonus semester to do whatever you want!
Well is the compensation good?   

What type of tech stack will you be gaining experience with?   

Do you want to be experienced and get more jobs with the aforementioned tech stack?   

Do you even like what you’ll be doing at Databricks? Personally never heard of it but if the experience and knowledge you’ll gain out of it seems important to you then I don’t see why it would hinder you in the future.

Do you see yourself accepting and reneging it later?  
If you are interested in distributed systems at all, take it. Their engineering bar is very high, and the founder is a Stanford professor who created Spark. They are well known within the DS community.
I'm not Canadian, but they're ghosting me too. Same with Microsoft. Does anybody know if these companies send out formal rejection letters?
lol why would you withdraw? all the canadians i talked to got a rejection from the US posting but who knows you could be a lucky one
if you pass you will be assigned to a recruiter; just tell them you made a mistake and they will fix it. google usually has another intern posting for bs students, but u probably chose the wrong one.
I haven’t even completed their hackerrank yet, any pointers? (Pun intended)
Are you done with your Akuna C++ interview?
I took the Google code sample and snapshot survey on 1/4 and my Google recruiter emailed me another questionnaire on 1/7 then on 1/8 my google recruiter email me that I will now move onto the next phase of the hiring process. She said she passed my information to the hiring team and a member will contact me in 1 week if they are interested so Im hoping that means I’ll get my interview scheduled soon.  
I did the Visa hackerrank and then had a skype interview. I got the optimal runtime solution but they still rejected me.
Yes alot of companies are flexible such as Google and Facebook
Just curious what sort of experience background u have to land that interview?
I write one cover letter and edit to the company name for each position I apply to.
i don't attach a cover letter as it is very likely that they won't open it
Did their hackerrank about 10 days ago. Haven't heard back.
I haven’t even heard back from them yet
I'll be interning there this summer, lmk if you take it! They took around a week to get back to me, so if theyre's a delay on top of that it might be a bit, I wouldn't worry 2 much. Esp bc at least 1 of their uni recruiters is new/switched as of like 2 weeks ago.
Hope you know your resume well. Some guy at my superday wrote down excel and they drilled him for like 10 minutes on all the obscure excel functions and operations and scripting and such.
Hey, I'm actually about to take it. Any tips?
[check this post out](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aho87g/just_got_an_offer_from_sap/?st=JR9DY4JH&sh=01676128) 

Also, how many or what iXP positions did you apply for? There are mad openings on the website and I have no idea what to apply too lol
Hey I haven’t interviewed but I was wondering if there was like a separate application or you got contacted?
People have started getting interviews but they’ve also rejected some people on resume so far. I spoke to recruiter last week and she said they’re still reviewing apps. 
The highest rated questions on Leetcode tend to show up regularly in interviews. You can sort by that and do the first 10/15.
Most companies will consider you. I got my first internship with a pretty big company. Although as a disclaimer I did have a previous unrelated degree. I also listed the university I intended transferring to on my resume.
you can try for department of energy internships
They didn't send anything to me.
Mine consisted of pairing correct values in an array and a binary tree problem.
I think Java is easier for the questions.  I hadn't used Java since HS and have been using c++ a lot but still felt like it'd be worse for interview type questions.  My recommendation is just do a lot of leetcode with Java to get used to it first
C++(stl is very useful)
You can change option while taking it, so just based on what you feel comfortable with for the question.
Know a guy who did, he went back for another internship so I guess he liked it!
No, map worked for me. But, the solution I provided on one of the problems was only passing a few test cases when it was the optimal solution.. I recreated it in my own environment with the same exact code and it works perfectly fine.
U should get ur resume reviewed. Also try to get referrals or reaching out to recruiters at the companies ur applying to get their attention. Being freshman does make it a lot harder. Lot of times, people chuck out ur resume just for that. Focus on small and local places u can apply to. 
It's hard to get an internship as a Freshman even with a high GPA. Try targeting smaller more local companies, good luck!
This sounds like a bad idea
Nah, I honestly think the advice to "follow up with your interviewer" is outdated. These people don't give their emails out or they would get a ton of emails "thanking them for the interview." 

I still do it out of caution (because literally everyone says to), but I honestly don't think it matters, especially when you'll just end up emailing the recruiter and asking them to tell the interviews thanks for you (which I doubt they actually do).
I got email as well, no confirmation after filling form though.
Did they give you your set interview date? 
Even I wrote my OA2 on March 4. But I did not get any email for virtual interview. Does this mean I am rejected?
Same with me, haven't got the confirmation. Filled the form 2 days ago.
I took March 6th and got Virtual round email couple days ago. Put all my free slots and got a response with my date and time couple days after (March 29)
Tell them that you’re unable to do this internship because you received an offer you couldn’t turn down.

But I can be completely wrong here. I’m curious as what others would say. Please keep me posted what you did because I may be on the same boat as well because I’m still interviewing with other companies. 
Just say you got a more competitive offer and that because you're trying to support yourself through school financially, it's important to you to take the more competitive offer. Ask if there's anything you can do to alleviate the impact of your withdrawal. If they got a decent HR department, it should be all fine. Don't pull some BS like u got sick and can't intern.
[deleted]
Same, I filled the availability form almost immediately afterwards. 
Yes, Took about 1 business day for them to send a confirmation. Beware though, it depends on their availability. 
I didn’t get one yet
Still waiting for mine.  Sent my dates on wednesday, didnt get a response.  
No response to my emails.
Yes. Got it like a day or two after submitting the poll and had my call today. I did OA2 early march. 
[deleted]
I did my interview last Friday and just heard back tonight with an offer.
No, it was a informal email that said "You will be getting a formal offer soon" but had no other details in it. If you have any questions, I'm sure they wouldn't mind it if you responded to the email.
can take up to a week they said in the email they send for the virtual interview, maybe even longer since this is the end of the recruiting season for them and they are processing a high volume of applicants
I did not, what about you. Please keep me updated, thank you!
first of all relax, have a casual conversation and try to connect with the guy during the call. At the end, you can say like "what you've said really interests me so I was wondering if it's possible to refer for an interview here". If ur too uncomfortable saying that, follow up in an email about a referral.
Super easy and this is coming from a kid who hasnt taken DS or Algos yet
It was easy 
Hirevue was easy
Hirevue was easy! Ended up getting an invitation to an on-site event including 1 behavioral and 1 technical interview (\~30 minutes each) a few weeks later. This was about 2 weeks ago, still haven't heard back but I've accepted another offer so I'm not going to press it. Behavioral was standard, technical was not so much coding knowledge but answering factual questions about various facets of coding (ie. recursion vs. iteration).
A little over 2 weeks for a positive response
What do they ask in the HireVue? All behavioral, or does it include coding?
I think most people who get the additional interview actually end up with the internship! Stay in there and don't get yourself down.
Not even close.
Nope.
Are you a soph or freshman? I'm not URM as well and interviewed for EP pending feedback. I don't think it made a difference for the interviewers - it's not like they give harder questions to non-URM, something i was worried before the interviewer. The interview feedback is also objective and straight to the point about how you did. The only people who would care about URM are the recruiters that do the screening and possibly Hiring Committee. My perception is that recruiters are responsible for making sure URM are targeted in the screening and the hiring committee focuses mostly on interview feedback regardless of your diversity unless they find some imbalance..
I was concerned about the same thing. I am definitely not a URM, but my essays were pretty quirky/funny/diverse and I think that's why I got an interview. I would think that the mere fact that you received an interview means they identify you as a candidate for this position, so at this point, it really is how well you performed on your interviews.

Otherwise, why would they bother with an interview? 

&#x200B;

PM me if you have any questions and good luck :)
[deleted]
Wow, well that sucks but it's good if it's true. But I also heard that they would bump you up to the normal SWE intern interviews if you are too qualified for the STEP.

When did you apply btw?
I did earlier this year. You can PM me if you have any questions about the process.
Twitch | Spotify | Robinhood | twilio
Google
Some people already have offers from Apple.
1 week
I know people who has done really well in OA2 and still waiting and it's been like 10 days.
I'm in the same boat, buddy. Good luck to you.
After how long did you get the first test (OA1) after you submitted the application? 
If you did decent on OA1 you shouldn't have anything  to worry about
I finished my sample last Friday and they told me they would email back about next steps on or before March 18th. So it seems it could take up to almost a month to hear back (at least for me) 
IME they take forever. I applied in early Sept and just started host matching last week. It took about 1.5 weeks to hear the "We want to interview you" and then 1.5 months to actually complete the interview. I assume they'll try to speed it up as it nears the summer though
It will be leetcode medium
[deleted]
congrats for making it in! i applied but got rejected from there :/



what did u apply for?
The memes were cute!
I was wondering the same thing. Fuck... guess they gave so much time for a reason then
Hey what was the question like ? 

What domain was it any idea, I have to finish it by Monday any help would be appreciated. 
got the swe challenge
I've heard they'll usually reject you pretty fast after OA2, might be a long wait to schedule interview cause a lot of people are in the process atm. Assuming you do get the virtual interview, they ask you to upload your most recent resume before the interview anyway (They might look at it to ask you questions about experience)
If/when you move on they'll ask you to upload your most recent resume leading up to your virtual interview
[deleted]
No confirmation email, just wait and they should respond within a week.
is this for summer or fall?
had one for data warehouse, it was leetcode-esque SQL and then 1 or 2 leetcode type questions
Wait, you got the offer before completing the HackerRank? Also, when I did it, the first two questions were a breeze, but I couldn't figure out the 3rd question - way too hard.
How long did it take for you to hear back after initially applying (like just sending in your resume)? i've been waiting over 2 weeks now
They're really easy. They say "are you technically a good fit for this job?" and you say "yeah". 
theyre going through interviews for last few spots - i wouldnt keep my hopes up unfortunately.
I think its the same as the back end. It's pretty easy imo if you have experience with a framework and database
Waiiiiit a minute. I just took this and got the same score. When did you hear back?
I wouldn't say it was easy, but I didn't find it too bad. Just one question. Know your graphs!
Hard
I'd advice  to wait for it. In my case I got the interview schedule the next day itself. All the best.
Most of my opportunities where I've applied, and got an interview, came from on-campus recruiting events (online apps tend to be dead for me). So, if you dont have American companies coming to your school, it makes the process much harder
No, I got an email to complete OA1 three days ago.
Don't think so
[deleted]
How long did it take for you to get a reply after oa2? 
How long did it take them to get back to you?
You know there's a reply button?
You know you can reply to people on reddit, right? 
It's fairly late, but everyone gets "Under consideration" or "under review". Good luck.
From what i've hears it seems to be a crapshoot. Some people do poorly and move on to the next round. Others do pretty well and don't move on. You don't need to finish it to move on. Most people who move on to the third round didn't do perfect on the OA2.
Pass what? 
I'm a returning intern and I think I may have mentioned my Google offer.
Pretty straightforward. Only leetcode easy and medium questions, no hard ones. I did poorly on my second one, so they gave me a third.
Winter. I skipped host matching because I am going back to the team I worked with before.
Nope, just a small Canadian university in my hometown. 
Yes, it was
Hey! I’m not entirely sure what my internship is going to be like, but I can definitely try to give you an idea. My project is most likely going to be a mix of product management and business analytics. Probably swaying more towards the PM side. Essentially, I’m going to be analyzing inefficiencies in the current tech and product that my company offers and coming up with solutions to improve them/save money/increase profits based on data analysis. 

Definitely way different than software developer work, but it’s very useful knowing CS and having development experience when analyzing things on the product side. Most of the other incoming interns I’ve communicated with are STEM majors with some economics or business background as well. 

Hope this helps! 
Nah, SWE Intern
I'm not too sure. I just had a third interview over hangouts. But I thought people in the US usually have an onsite so I wrote that as "onsite". I technically had three phone interviews.
No not typically 
For APM, yes
I never got past the first two chapters of CTCI. To prepare I mostly did leetcode everyday. At first I started going data structure by data structure. So, I would spend a few days just doing questions which can be solved using stacks. Then, I would move on to Linked List and so on. That helped me get an intuition about what sort of question requires which kind of special data structure if any.

After about two-three weeks of that I just went on to try as many leetcode questions I could solve in a day. I made a list of the questions I found useful and a separate list of the technique/trick that I had learnt from that question (such as using two pointers for the rabbit and hare linked list problem). This helped me because when I would get stuck during an interview, I would think of my techniques list and in most cases, it was one of the techniques from that list which would be the answer to the question. 
Yeah lOL i got rejected <24hrs after a horrible phone screen
After snapshot I got email to schedule interview
Yea I haven’t heard from anyone interviewing with twitch 
Which on site did you fail? Yup, I just want to get interviewed too, like, "give me a chance to show you what I'm about and show you my skills :("
I think about a week after I applied 
8k/mo & housing, very competitive.
The coding challenge I got was doable, reasonably challenging. My phone interview was strange - it began with a lot of algorithmic trivia including some Quicksort minutiae involving different partitioning schemes and pivot choices which I wasn’t prepared for. Programming problem was reasonable but I was thrown off from the initial questions. I would think this speaks more to my interviewer than the company’s process as a whole.
Target school I would say, Top 10 CS.
Maybe they just did half and half to ghost people later 
"At this time, we have decided not to move forward with your candidacy. You are welcome to apply for future opportunities next fall when the 2020 application opens in August."
Didn’t remember file reading and writing and shit and it was a time crunch 😬
I’m also taking DSA this semester
Hi unfortunately the recruiter contact I have was assigned after my process started, so I don't have one for the initial 'give resumes to managers > managers pick who they interview' phase. They don't recruit at my school's career fair either, but I'd say if you can go to undergraduate conferences (this is where I chanced upon an Apple booth)/hackathons where they are that might be helpful! Else I have heard of people just applying online or reaching out to a random university recruiter on linkedin (premium free trial comes in clutch here). Good luck! 
They got back to me the same day, but I had completed the test in the morning 
For OA1, work fast. It’s debugging, so there will be a function with code written that compiles but doesn’t do what it should. There’s only a few lines you need to change to fix it. Manage your time and if you spend too much time on a problem, move to the next. 

For OA2, I hear there’s many possible questions to get. Be comfortable using data structures. I got a hashtable and graph problem. Got all of the hashtable correct and only one test passing for the graph and they moved me on. 
Any companies which are actively hiring ?  
It seems all my applications are going into the abyss, rarely do I get a response, even though my profile is decent, with some reasonable good experience which I though would be a catch.
Yeah, positions in the tech capitals (Seattle, Bay Area, NY) get flooded with applicants from all over the world. Hard to stand out.
Cerner 
1500 hours of interview prep in one year is more hours of studying than I have hours gaming to a game that I was addicted to. I don't think it's commitment, more like some mental abnormality lol (not in a bad way).

I get tired after doing like 3 LC in a week
I wish leetcode had debugging questions similar to the ones on OA1. I would have done much better if I had an idea of what to expect going in.
I did decently.  I got about 70% of the test cases both known and unknown. I didn't hear back from OA2 until about 2 weeks after I took it so you should be fine.
Just a heads up, it's been 3 weeks for me after completing OA2. Be ready for a long wait lol
interviewed on wednesday and got the offer on friday 
the pay seems to be the same. at least mine is the same as what i’ve read from last year. I see it as something big is happening with amazon this year
Haven't they bumped the housing stipend compared to last yr(2500-3500)
Just one about linked lists. No i never got a working a solution which is why i was so confused when i got the offer
I applied on LinkedIn haha. And yeah so much of this shit is luck of the draw - whether they reach out, the questions you get... 
There's an app called LeetCoder that gives you free access to the locked FB specific problems. And check out Career Cup too. Very good chance it's a repeated problem. 
No sorry, I don't have a redacted version :( 

&#x200B;

I think I'm trying to choose both Google and Facebook. Trying to push back Facebook to an off-season internship.

EDIT: Was able to push Facebook back to Fall '19.
One prior internship at a fairly well known company. Nope! Just phone interviews.
It was pretty easy! He just asked me questions related to finding proper bracketing in strings, and gradually made the problem a little more complex to hear how I would change my approach.
Thanks! I think I'm trying to get put in NYC but if that fails I will PM you. :) 
I had a deadline, so I got my offer 2 days after my final interview.
Yeah, I just applied online.
Yeah I did. And I think that's fine. It just means they want more interview feedback, because your feedback was probably mixed.
I entered the pool beginning of October, but host matching didn't start until last Wednesday. Since then, I got 2 interviews and matches that I got to pick from.
Sure, but their onsite is exactly like how they describe it in the doc they give you. Feel free to PM me if you have a specific question that's not "How was the onsite?", haha
Just Dropbox, I was one test case off, but the problem was pretty hard.
One medium!
Thanks! I'm a junior. Just power through it! When I was a sophomore, I didn't start recruiting 'till November and didn't get my offer until February. You're doing super well if you're already interviewing I think. Just study for your interviews as if they're an additional subject, and try to do some mock interviews in advance. Good luck!
Just wondering, did you ever try to get put in NYC? And thank you!
I feel like it’s pretty strong and their team matching is good. I chose FB/G because of location preferences, but if I didn’t have them, I’d probably do Pinterest and Facebook.
I think some people have had offers but I'm not sure if that was for internship, I'm sure someone can confirm
It was just a link to sign up on jumpstart and fill in your info, interests, etc.
Freshman year I had a family friend who was able to get me a position at his company. To be completely honest I probably shouldn't have been given that one, but it turned out pretty well when I worked there. For sophomore year, Amazon recruited heavily out of my school, and with a company already on my resume, I was able to get to the online assessment and proceeded to do well on that and the interviews. I don't think I had any personal projects on my resume at that point besides a robotics club I was currently in.
Sorry for the late reply! It took about a week or 2 to hear back after the final round. FB gives you a list of start dates and some of those are for fall, so you don't even need to do anything special other than choose one of those dates.
Tip is definitely to relax during the interview, I understand it’s a big N and everyone wants to work there, but the additional stress definitely doesn’t help.

That’s all I can say since it worked for me, I don’t wanna give some BS advice and pretend it’ll work for everyone 
Trying out twitter 
So far, I’ve only seen google for fall 2019. Someone please prove me wrong and tell me others lol 
oh man, fingers crossed I suppose! Good luck on the search!
I didn’t get a chance to do any challenges just straight rejection 
it's relatively easy dont stress about it
Thank you! I’ll try to get a resume with my info redacted and PM you but if I forget you can remind me LOL
Yeah written. Congrats man! You should get the written one in around a day
They were alright. Pretty sure it’s a hirevue after the logic assessment, and it was pretty standard, but fast paced. On-site was structured well but I think I was a bit too slow on the technical portion. 
My final round was 2 weeks ago from today and no response yet so I’m assuming I’m rejected 
same! way too late for me though :(
The process is first a 2 leveled online assessment. Part 1 is logic and Debugging, part 2 is a straight coding assignment.

Then if you do well (probably like top X% of candidates) you get a final round interview
same.
Haha exactly man! I’m definitely a little better than before but plenty of other opportunities I’m still in the running for. I hope host matching is a success for you dude!
I thought it went well for the most part. For most interviews, I usually had a good sense of whether I would move on or be rejected afterwards, but with googles interviews I was 50/50 about whether I would move on.   


My first interview honestly was a curveball, and despite what seemed intimidating, I was able to solve I'd say 95% of it and unable to code for a small base case which I figured out, but did not code at the end. Interviewer was pretty average, wasn't too vocal except at the end. I assumed that was average/  


My second interview went very well imo. Clicked with the interviewer, solved both questions pretty quickly and vocalized my thought process throughout.   


I thought I was completely vocal about my thought process, and I definitely thought about edge cases, ways my code can break, timing, and hoped that I would advance. Unfortunately it didn't work out and Im just a little discouraged because as a sophomore, most companies aren't looking to hire someone who just started to take DS/Algos, and those that have a specific frosh-soph program seemed to either reject me after interviews, yet to let me know about final interviews, or didnt even start their recruitment process. Life goes on I guess LOL
Was actually interested in the return offer rate. Like company A gives full time return offer to roughly X% of interns. But thanks for sharing. 
Like /u/SecretAgentB said, mostly LinkedIn and Google's job search feature. It's not 170 different companies though, it's 170 total applications spread among probably 90 companies. A good chunk are small-ish startups. I'm planning on making a big diagram to show my hunt once it's over, I currently have a spreadsheet keeping of my applications.
LinkedIn and Indeed and any other job board. So many Software engineering internships outside of NY, WA, and CA lol
Just wondering, when did you start applying for internships?
>Capital One

Doesn't cap1 not sponsor f1 students anymore for full time? I know it doesn't matter for internship but I am surprised they are hiring interns who are on f1. 
OMG it must be really competitive to proceed then :( Good luck!!
PM me your resume and I'd be happy to help you out
Haha thanks! Maybe "non-flagship" would've been better as we're definitely not the best public CS school in our state. 

The Big-4 do actively recruit here, but we don't have the smaller, more prestigious firms like Hudson River Trading, Jane Street, Citadel, Airbnb, etc
Depends on what team you're interviewing for, I've heard teams like AI + Research and Azure ask harder questions. From my experience, a good mix of LeetCode medium and hard, with a few behavioral q's thrown in.
Just had my interview at Microsoft a few weeks ago and accepted an offer from the shortly after. They definitely will ask behavioral questions. Some at the beginning of each interview. Then they move onto technical questions in the last two thirds of the interview.
I should clarify that I'm not a research intern but a SWE for an AI team. I am an undergrad junior, but I included a couple of my publications (one of which has \~45 citations) in my application (and maybe indicated interest in AI? can't remember). Anyway, they told me at the on-site that I'd be interviewing with/for an AI team, which I did not expect.
Thanks! Same to you!
Thanks, you too! They said my team won't be finalized until 2 months before I start or something like that.
Do you say this because they're similar enough in prestige?
Not with internships per se, but I did work with some data science research at a local college a couple summers ago.
Thank you! Always grinding. 
Uhhh
Where are you applying? I can’t attend any in-person fairs or anything, and LinkedIn and Glassdoor seem to be dead ends. 
LA office offer was:

9000$/month, corporate housing, free flight to LA, 300$ relocation assistance.

Then all the perks of the office (pc bangs, free all meals, etc) and Rioter benefits (3000rp monthly, riot account, 30$/mo play fund)

Yeah the interview process was really long but I really wanted to work at Riot so I was willing to go through it haha
Hi, of course! CZI was one of the best interview experiences I've ever had. They hosted an event in SF which I went to, found me afterwards via the resume I submitted at the event and booked calls. Phone interview was fairly easy and the engineer was super friendly and accommodating. Afterwards I was flown out to Palo Alto office (they're in Redwood city now) to do onsites. One social event the night before the onsites so you can meet your interviewers and recruiters. At every step the recruiter provided feedback, study materials, and clear insights into what next steps looked like. 

Onsite was two tech and one behavioural. First tech was pretty challenging but very fair and the interviewer and I walked through solution structures together. Second one was open book, meaning the interviewer gave you a problem and asked you to solve it, with full access to websites and documentation. We consulted Stack overflow a bunch of times lol. Finally the behavioral was standard, stuff like leadership, collaboration, conflict resolution, etc. They did ask a question about diversity and if I had experienced any struggles in the past that made me who I am today. 

Overall, I felt that everyone who works there is 120% dedicated to their mission, so really understanding and resonating with their objectives is really important. I absolutely loved talking to everyone who worked there and was super impressed. If you like the field of philanthropy and R&D, I strongly recommend you check them out. 

EDIT: got the CZI offer! Stoked :)
Did you pass all the test cases for twilio hackerrank by any chance? 
I did Amex and they reached out 3 weeks later and have a phone interview on Monday (but this is in UK tho') 
I did Amex and they reached out 3 weeks later and have a phone interview on Monday (but this is in UK tho') 
now we gotta wait till Monday. That's when you'll hear back. lmk your results
Like after the technical interviews?
Nope. Similar but didn't mention the timeline for when I'd hear back or next steps
For real? Damn
I completed the hackerrank yesterday (perfect coding score but 1 math question wrong) and got rejected this morning

Truly do not know why, I guess they want 100% math
+1 for having an excel sheet :)
Here's a rundown of my resume.

&#x200B;

**School**: Not target for CS but nationally ranked overall

**Year**: Sophomore

**GPA**: \~3.4/4.0

**Relevant coursework**: Comp Sci 1 and 2, How to Design Programs, Algos, Data Structures, Programming Language Implementation, Working with Excel, Working with Neural Networks, Calculus 1 and 2, Discrete, Linear

**Work experience**: Peer tutor, volunteer, co-founder of non-profit (also maintains the website)

**Projects**: Personal website and blog, a few educational video games, sequent calculus calculator

**Programming Languages**: HTMl/C#/JS (advanced), Node.js/CSS/Python (proficient), SML/Pyret/Java (basic)

**Honors**: Questbridge Scholar, National Hispanic Scholar, LEDA Career Scholar, three-time state champion in speech/debate events

&#x200B;

I didn't get an internship my freshman summer. I just took a few math classes at a local college.

&#x200B;

Edit: I have no idea why posts like this get downvoted.
I'm legally hispanic, but other than listing the fact that I'm a National Hispanic Scholar, I don't talk about it on applications or interviews unless explicitly asked.
Feelsbadman. I'm waiting for the day I can be those people on /r/recruitinghell with 10 recruiters tryna contact them everyday 
Already had an offer 
Getting interviews was pretty lucky I think, I didn't have any references or referrals. Once I got the interviews, I'm pretty confident in my coding ability so while they were challenging they weren't impossible for me. 
With Google EP we get guaranteed host matches, and I'm still in the process. 
I'm unfamiliar with Facebook (declined the interview) but I think the top tech companies are generally the same. PM me
Here's a summary of my resume:

* 3.8+ GPA
* State School known for CS program
* Interned at Amazon my sophomore year

&nbsp;

I got the most luck applying online. Pretty much every interview here came from an online application. It's important to apply as soon as you see the job link, it makes it easier for you to stand out in the early batches of resumes and increases the chances of a callback (and can get you into the pipeline earlier)
Definitely a direct result of increased work experience. I think the callback rate would have been much lower without 2 internships under my belt.
Thanks! I'll take two of these, one for Spring and one for Summer.
He was already at FB, and Quora/Two Sigma are considered more prestigious than Microsoft (not saying prestige necessarily matters, but a lot of people care about it). Quality of interns will be higher, but honestly I'm not convinced Quora has very good full time software engineers because their product runs like shit.
Yes - I go to a school that has a lot of recruitment, which was a huge help. The vast majority of my interviews stemmed from face-to-face interaction at career fairs and the like. Most of my online applications disappeared into the void and I never heard back.
I applied online 
Career fair at my school
Ctci and leetcode mainly. It's just to make sure to spread it out
Yeah I got a call about their on-site event thing a few days back. I did the video interview around 2/3 weeks ago iirc
I have a video interview, any tips?
Not much so far, my next interview with them is the first one for me with Northrop
It's been really rough ngl but I guess the key is to prepare consistently over time, cuz by the time an interview is scheduled you won't stress/cram for it as much
That's basically the issue I'm facing haha, but there are worse problems to have
I'm a junior, and yeah! PM me!
Career fair
I don't think there's anything wrong with his resume. The reality is just that there's too many people in CS now.
This is the 7th weeks, still haven’t received any updates. How’s it going with you? 
I'm a sophomore, and I preferred EP as well since there's guaranteed host matching, but my recruiter said I didn't really have a choice. I'm not too sure either since my new recruiter hasn't given me any information yet. I think it was based on my interview performance, since my recruiter said the hiring committee looked over the feedback and decided I performed at SWE interview level. I don't think I have to do the technical interviews again, however, which is nice, but I do think I will have to do the online coding assessment still. 
it was a week after I applied
mine was virtual - it was fairly straightforward, i just bombed the second interview
I don't have a ton of experience with Bloomberg, but my general impression has been that they are perfectly content with having an extremely high rejection/false negative rate, even more so than the rest of the top companies.
Dude I thought that senior manager round (last round right?) is just general behavioral talk and most likely guarantees an offer. What questions did you get asked? Did you interview at NYC or London?
I was ready for those lol but I got a distributed computing question... which I've never thought about before.
Senior manager was part of my on campus interviews for some reason, I got rejected before on site. I got a distributed computing question, and that whole interview was just off. Talked with friends after and they had similar experiences, just weird questions all around.
Like I said - top 10 for CS. You can probably find out through post history if you want.
Haha my resume wasn't super hot but all the companies that did move me forward were either through the career fair or through Handshake.
Same thing happened to me lol. TBF I applied about 2 days before the deadline and they said later applications have lower acceptance rates.
what did they ask?
Yes, I did and was rejected.
i got the coding challenge but its been a week since i submitted and no response. does it mean i got rejected too?
No, nothing. Just a rejection email.
I was able to apply to more than one, so I guess yes? No clue on how it gets handled on their end. (i.e. if they'll consider you separately for both)
I had a behavioral/general AI knowledge interview and a review of my take home challenge interview followed by an interview with the manager of the team (this was for a data science position). 

From what I can see most interviews go like this in that you have a couple technical phone rounds followed by a final interview with the manager.
Id rather not publicly disclose myself, but I basically had a research paper, 2 internships (1 high school 1 freshman), and 2 personal projects (a compiler and an ML related one)
>not true

That's great then! :D I just said that because the website seems to be lacking positions, but I guess this means that more people should be going out to their on-campus events if possible.

&#x200B;
No definitely not. I'd get started though. It's kind of like applying to college, go for some boring but high chance places, some mediums, and some reaches. Seems everyone wants interns, though particularly juniors.
One previous internship, plus a year of research experience leading to a publication, and some minor TA experience. I think the research was the big thing; it definitely seemed to be what most companies were most interested in discussing during the interviews.
You too! :)
Funny cause they give the longest time limit and had the easiest questions. Some coding challenges took me until close to the end to figure out and I failed LendingHome's but I did Twitter's 4 questions within half an hour and pretty sure I got optimal/close to optimal solutions for all of them.
Sorry, I didn't see this comment. I heard from MongoDB around a week or two ago. I applied around mid-September.
Roblox's coding challenge was pretty hard. A couple of the questions I couldn't get every single test case to pass, and that might have been one of them. If you PM me the question I would be happy to see if I remember, although I did not get a great solution for it.
2 interviews, one was leetcode questions and the other was system design questions.
So there was an official rejection email sent to you?
Hello, When did you apply for the amazon internship, and when did they send the OA to you? 

&#x200B;

I applied at the end of august, and haven't heard anything yet.
Congrats! Similar timeline as you so I hope I hear back soon, hopefully with good news
Yea of course.


The first interviewer didn't give me any hints or guidance at all. It was a really unconventional problem, wasn't used to it.

The first problem was fine, but then the second part was pretty hard for a particular edge case. 

The second interview went well I think? I got the optimal solution for both problems.

All in all I think I prepared decently, but I probably could've prepared more. I also want the search to be over, but I won't get my hopes up. Remember it's sophomore year, there's still plenty of time. I prepared by doing a lot of leet code easy and some mediums and would code it on a Google doc while talking out loud (to myself).
Thank you!! I went over these last night and my interview went great. :D
Thanks!! I let the interviewer know in the beginning that I was inexperienced, and he accordingly modified the questions. :) It went really well
Yes, my interviews were Tuesday. I hope that means I had good feedback, I'm just concerned that all the spots will be filled by 11/29 even though that's probably not the case
I have a competing offer deadline so maybe I was told the date so I would know if they were moving forward before my deadline?
I've wondered that too. I also think it might vary from recruiter to recruiter. Imo I have a really good one, she communicates well, responds quickly, and roots for me during my candidacy
SWE
[deleted]
The recruiter mentioned last week before Thanksgiving that he was still waiting on someone to give feedback 
[deleted]
2 array questions, not too hard, one of them was just confusing for me.
Is it a rejection if they take that long?
Yeah this stuff is weird. They didn't reject me but in the careers thing it says the position is Not Available 
hey, thanks so much! i applied on the 31st LOOL and i'm a freshman
I applied in August and heard back I think in October.
Do you mind PMing me details?
Did you get an offer? 
I applied late August and just got it last week!
yeah, I was aiming for 5/7 but it was my first time experiencing a time constraint that rough before. Nothing else to do but hope I get OA2 somehow at this point, hopefully you get it!! 
Yeah I got rejected, it’s probably 5/7 - 7/7 to get OA2. At least I know what to expect for next year!! (Or in 6 months)
How were your results for it? Like how many test cases did you get for each problem? 
[deleted]
Thank you! I ended up taking JP Morgan.
The ones I filled out yeah
Just applied to their general software engineering internship position 
I would say about half of my interviews were technical as in pure testing of code knowledge, and the other half was behavioral with questions more about high-level tech knowledge and my personality. 

I skim requirements to check if they have a grad year requirement and if the work seems interesting. Internship postings don't really seem to have many requirements in my experience, usually just requiring you to know one language out of a list of languages. I would say my qualifications didn't 100% match with the listed requirements for any of my offers and I think that's expected by most recruiters, for internships at least.
For sure! Here is my [Anon Resume](https://imgur.com/a/bPUgXvG). There is a lot of space, usually the page is filled to the brim but I had to take a lot of stuff off for privacy reasons. Hope this helps!
[deleted]
TBH it's been so long I forgot what type of q OA2 asked me.  However its prob best if you looked into graphs and hashmaps since someone mentioned those can be tested in the interview. 
Nope never got
Ah so it is standard practice! It was Amazon canada that sent me the offer in the first place though.
No I didn't, my choices were Winnipeg, Vancouver and Toronto. I heard back within 6-7 days, but they say to wait 7 business days before emailing them.
Spotify has already closed its applications like a month ago for the US though
I don't think shopify has opened yet?

I am still on amazon's bad boy list from turning them down last year. Already applied to tumblr. 

was referred to Spotify but the person who referred me told me its a no go :( 
Yeah but it's not a tech company, more like a big company with a great tech department. 

Last internship so I'm still on the lookout for unicorns
Yeah mate, still salty/sad about it
Do companies sponsor you to get a visa? And if they do is it an easy process?
Its actually insane. My virtual interview problems were barely LeetCode easy. Literally everyone I know is getting interviews from Amazon.
Yeah that’s no joke. I’m pretty sure my amazon interview was the easiest one I did. Could be just anecdotal though, since their OA2 had a semi obscure algorithm involved.
Last year there was no interview for interns, this year they are taking one
[deleted]
Yeah but the field is required and I don't know what to put in there. Currently applying for Explore
Projects aren't even approved yet. Source: my recruiter
I got my Google offer a few days ago, at least for EP you accept your offer and THEN move to the project matching phase (which doesn't start until November). (Edit: my offer is for summer 2019).
[deleted]
When was it?
Did you contact any recruiters? Or did you just hear back from applying online?
do you have Tinder, Coinbase, Robinhood?
Thanks, and is it normal to receive this before an interview? Most of the people on this sub seem to have gotten it after
how do you know when you've moved onto project matching?
SWE. Thanks for the tip and good luck to you too! 
Congrats! It's been almost 2 weeks since mine. No feedback.
Last year people I know who got rejected got told they got rejected.
first off. how well did you do on your two phone interviews last year? and did you email your recruiter for a follow up
i completed my phone interviews on oct 23 havent heard back since. :wah:
I did mine this Monday lol 
I don't think I would recommend this
I did, it was so damn hard. 2 Graph questions and code review in java
Yeah, well I don't get it why even send such an easy coding challenge.

I think it was around week after completing it.
Will failure lesson my chances of future internships with Google?
> s well. I had a pretty solid interview, but I haven't heard anythig

Same here. Do you know anyone who received an offer?
Do you still get the housing stipend if you live close by? Unsure on the policy for that 
I applied for the SWE one back in October, took their HackerRank, still nothing
When did you interview and how long was it after the coding round?
Hey,   
How long was your interview ? What type of questions were asked to you?
I wonder why he deleted his comments...
[deleted]
I felt it went pretty well. I was just happy to get any callbacks as a freshman with little experience. None of the questions were very technical. 
I'm in the same situation as you, same position, didn't even do one problem and also sorta got another one. However, I feel that it's a goodish sign that we haven't heard back from them yet. Every other Hackerrank I've taken I got the rejection at most 2 days afterward, and from my previous experience, Blizzard doesn't ghost rejects. I also watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hhKdRSElZ4) and she talks about how she did the same, didnt solve one, iffy on the others, but she still moved forward. Hopefully we move on!
I did the same damn thing for that hackerrank, passed first 3 then rest just didn’t have long enough data types. I’m hoping my commenting/explaining my thought process means a lot because I only finished two of the three but explained what I would do with more time.
Same, did the Hackerrank coding challenge for the [battle.net](https://battle.net) intern position and still no response after 10days. But Jobvite doesn't have anything information about this position.
I got back 4 more rejections last night for the positions:

* Software Engineer Intern, Server
* Software Engineer Intern, Engine
* Software Engineer Intern, UI
* Software Engineer Intern

On Jobvite, I still have:

**New**

* Software Engineer Intern, C++
* Software Engineer Intern, Java
* Software Engineer Intern, Web and Mobile

**In Process**

* Software Engineer Intern, Server Features
* Software Engineer Intern, Graphics
* Software Engineer Intern, Gameplay
yeah thats what I thought too. Did the same thing last year and I thought oa1 was exceptionally easy and moved onto the final stage (declined interview). I felt like this year was a lot more to read? Like just reading the damn questions took a lot of time already. 
How did ya do
around 2 weeks back
Wow, what are those big companies? Where are you come from? It is good though you got called for the technical interviews. My friends and I tried to apply to hundred companies in US but all of us got ghosted :(
Congratulations, thank you for the information bro. 
wow, congratulations... I got scheduled for a phone interview with Bloomberg UK but they canceled it because they said the slot is already full.
Thanks a ton! What are some general topics for OA2 questions? 

Also, did you get a chance to interview?
Thanks :) It's a BI/Analytics role. I was rejected from the straight DS roles due to graduation year (story of my life...). 
I have no experience in that situation
My final step was a phone call with one of the engineers on the team that I would be working on. I was about an hour and we worked on one coding question then talked about me a little and then he let me ask question about the job or about him. 
I interviewed with them directly. AWS came to my school for a career fair 
Yeah, I interviewed with AWS directly. 
hey, did you get your offer letter. "I just got a form to fill three preferences" i got the same no response then
Ty. Amazon
Do you think there's actually a difference between the time you interview and the hiring bar? I feel like it's more about your specific interviewer and how you did as opposed to when you interviewed. However, i'm not sure if there was actually a hiring spree as i'm waiting to do my virtual interview. Sorry to hear though man. 
[deleted]

I tend to love operations intensive companies. It really fascinates me how they are revolutionizing one of the oldest and most basic industry. I see a lot of potential and it seems like a company with huge learning potential and interesting problems. I also like their tech stack a lot and have a bit of experience with it. And also their CEO, ryan is a very cool and inspiring guy. 

If you don't mind me asking, why do you ask?
I had a referral from a friend. I go to the University of Maryland.
interned at FB and a smaller unicorn this past summer and winter. 
$26/hr
Hey CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:  
Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially "remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word".

You're useless.

Have a nice day!
How long after submitting your video did Verizon take to send you the same message as /u/ConsciousPhotsso9?
Any tips for on site for summer internship?
yeah
Thank you. I'm sure it is this simple, but I'm just worried.
Best of luck! Do Canadian students work in Canada or do they come to the US?
[deleted]
Lmao same I legit waited a month and a half for the rejection after hirevue
Thanks. By past project, do you mean they ask about a personal project listed on CV? Also, do they ask questions about your CV, ask you to code in a random one of your listed languages?
Good news? :)
Did you interview on the 8th? It's been exactly 3 weeks for me too, but haven't heard back yet.
[deleted]
How were the two interviews?
So you were rejected after the OA? Did they email you or did you see your status change? 
Thank you for the tips! I had a 6 hour study session yesterday and I already feel better. The more problems I do, the more techniques I learn and the more Python syntax I know. I still dont think I will be ready in time for my EP interview, but I'm going to try my hardest!
Tried this last night and my roommate wanted to know why I was talking to myself haha. Thanks!!
Christ a month after you interviewed?? Emailed the recruiter and was told likely by end of month (October) although now it's November. Apparently they're backlogged at the moment or something.
They were the ones who contacted me so all I had to do was make an account on their portal and respond to the recruiter. But I think this is the right link: [https://g.co/kgs/TNb1BL](https://g.co/kgs/TNb1BL) 
Same, the people I've heard with matches are returning interns
This helps me feel better. I found out I was moving to HC late September and got worried that it's not going to work out bc I've gotten no interviews either.
I feel you. I already secured a spot at another place for the summer. For now, Google Winter is just a nice to have, but its a REALLY NICE TO HAVE. LOL. My concern is that I started host matching beginning of October. From what is being said in the subreddit, projects only started being approved recently. So is the beginning of Oct being counted towards the 6 weeks???
I'm confused, didn't you already get to host matching? You mentioned in another comment in this thread 
I found them through an on-campus event last spring and so actually just emailed my resume directly to a recruiter, so I can't speak to the resume drop portion of the process, but iirc I received a coding challenge (they give you two weeks to do it once you open it and allow you to look up anything you need to, so I found it very fair); a phone interview discussing your coding challenge and asking you a follow-up + to discuss a past project of yours; a few online personality tests; and an onsite, which was two rounds (culture fit + technical whiteboarding). A lot of the interview process centers on their rather unusual culture, so be aware of that going in and remember that with Bridgewater you're allowed (and encouraged!) to be more honest about yourself and your impressions of the company than you usually would at a job interview.
So I actually got my resume in front of PwC by applying for a scholarship to a conference and then got my offer after an "on campus" behavioral + case interview while I was there. It was also more of a consulting-sort role than a SWE role (though still technical, just not as technical as I'd like). Also, I think I go to a target school for consulting (I don't know the industry at all, but it seems like a lot of liberal arts people here go into consulting).
It's not! I found it very practical, and their interview guide is spot-on. It's one object design interview that looks to see how you'd break down and abstract something like tic-tac-toe or battleship into objects and functions; one refactoring interview, where you go through some code they've written and make it stylistically better (it also tests your ability to read through code you've never seen before); and then your typical hiring manager interview, where you talk about your past experience. The people were really friendly and responsive throughout (I really hate when you get an interviewer that just sits there and says nothing the whole time).
Thanks! That's good to know. Definitely was overthinking that haha
Do you happen to know if hostmatching also applies to EP candidates ?
Sad yeet :(


Jks first one went well but botched the second one 
Haha nah. This [one](https://www.sabre.com/)
How long ago did you take it? Ik someone who took it a couple weeks earlier than me who got a phone interview and there have been a few people mentioning offers but not many. Assuming they're just backed up.
Snap only recruits through on campus events or referrals
Plus it takes like 1min to apply. Well worth the time
I don’t care about big names tbh, I just want experience. Even if it’s with a smaller place. Besides there is no way I would stand a chance with a big name place anyway so. 
pinged you!
A week ago.
It might be sent in batches. I just yesterday got a hackerrank from Niantic which many people already got a week ago.
yes I it was unbelievably easy, and didnt get anything back yet
Still have to wait like a month since they sent me a rejection post final interview 5months ago for the fall term ;_;
heard back?
Yeap. Thought about waiting and preparing, but couldn't resist :) Questions aren't hard, but couldn't optimize first question. Some say it may take up to 2 weeks for response so let's pray and wait. 

Btw, notify here if u get in. If I do as well, God willing, let's grab a coffee in summer ;)
mind if i pm?
Thanks for your response! Did you get any interviews or samples? Or no?
They weren't too difficult.  They looked intimidating at first, but after getting started it got easier.  One dealt with going through strings and the other a binary tree.  I realized i messed up a calculation for the binary tree so that's probably why i got some wrong.  Overall though i think my issue was optimizing it.  My first one ran in O(n\^2) when it could probably be written  in O(n) so that's probably why i didnt get some of the test cases for that one.
Damn if you didn't get it with 90% passing I doubt I will.  It could have also been because you closed out of it early.
congrats, good luck in the interview round 
I would look at this website:
https://aonecode.com/getArticle/215

Some of the questions on there are similar or the same as some questions I got. 
You are free to use any language. The coding questions are probably easy to medium LC.
Do they email you or give you a call?
Just under 2 weeks I think. I passed all the tests in OA2.
2 weeks, 7/7 and 5/7
Congrats! how difficult was the virtual interview? I've never had a technical interview so i'm super nervous. Anything specific I should practice?
2 coding questions then about your past experiences 
Debugging was pretty straight forward. Make sure you have a pen and paper for the logic part.
Ohh and did you answer everything well?
Yep.
I looked up the question on leet code, and it's considered hard.

He did ask me a medium difficulty question afterwards, but by then, we were running out of time so I didn't have enough time to figure out the solution

~~and i'm kicking myself cause I literally coded a solution to that problem about a year ago in my data structures class and I blanked~~
I passed 6/7 on OA1 and all but one test case for my second problem on OA2. They got back to me in about a week. If you don't get a response by then, no harm in sending them an email asking for a status update.

EDIT: You should be fine mostly for your online assessment.
Not really other than name drop some projects on your questionnaire. I got 3 matches in the first week after doing that. 
you can read my post for more detail, but pretty much I passed hiring committee and host matching then was told they cannot extend an offer despite my recruiter saying i will receive one within 2 days. 
Leetcode mediums! I found them easier than Facebook, because Facebook was my first interview of the season and they immediately hit me with a DP problem, haha. I didn't have to reinterview for Google; in the end I thought they were tough but doable. 
I had recruiters reach out from some of these companies (Two Sigma, Palantir). The rest were online resume drops or through chatting with the companies at GHC. Microsoft and Facebook were through my dedicated school recruiter. 
Jane Street and Citadel, I think. 
I applied on October 16
Thank you , I’m definitely gonna send them an email. Did you mention the exact offer details like company and deadline date or just kept it vague?
I did this and my response was "Every hiring committee date is full until 11/29. Please ask for an extension for your other offer. Sorry for the inconvenience!". That was during a surge of recruitment that was taking place in early November, though. Maybe now that it has calmed down more dates are available...
got rejected from lyft as well, but my recruiter said it was because they filled their spots
Thanks for the reply! How many days did you have to wait to get your first interview though?
[deleted]
Nah, I already canceled the other interviews and am taking the return offer - finally got it in writing yesterday, and I'm guaranteed a host match which makes things much less stressful. Practice is nice but I'm busy this semester and don't want to put in more effort for a negligible benefit.

Honestly if I didn't get the return offer I might've just gone with Amex and called it a day anyway, so I wouldn't have to juggle exams and interviews. NYC is fun, commute's not terrible and the pay is pretty good ($7500/month, $5k signing). I just wanna be done with it all lol.
Current junior at a small-ish state school. CS major + stat minor (used to be double major but dropped), pretty good grades, some clubs/extracurriculars but nothing fancy. I'm getting into research this year at least. Summer after freshman year I interned at a local startup, and this past summer I did Google EP.
I got contacted a couple days ago, " We’ll be reaching out to provide details regarding next steps in mid/late January. "
I got contacted and they said they would reach out again in mid/late january.
this softheon or lending home?
Did you hear back from them?
Haha, yeah they have some serious problems at lendinghome. I had a phone inteview with them. After which I received an email to schedule a technical interview. But then I didn't hear anything back after trying to reach them countless times, with email, linkedin etc. Then month after last email, I received an automated rejection email, haha.
Oh okay thank you!
You haven’t heard any offers or interviews? It mentioned if we haven’t been contacted by the end of Dec then we probably didn’t get it but I haven’t heard of anyone who has gotten anything positive
Hm but also last years deadline was jan so ://
I mean i hope its this, but i doubt it. Also congrats and good luck!
Also, when did you apply? 
Yeah sure. I hope I'll have something to update about, bcs I'm guessing I will be ghosted :)
true true yeah thats what i figured. I think I was just worried that they were ghosting me and like I didn't actually move onto the next stage
Damn. Guess that’s GG for me.
wow congrats!
whats HC?
did you get something back?
Not very hard, but I think I didnt do perfectly.

It was just fine.
Thank you!
Yes im a dumbass but I recieved an offer from a better bank the day before so i didn't care
I mean fair play I guess lol. I applied like the first week of September, still nothing. I cannot take this reeeeeeeeeeeee.
Yup!
Idek they sent rejections tbh. I thought they ghost you 
yeah tinder and snap are lowkey 
LinkedIn doesn’t show a lot in my area...and when I’ve asked companies in my area they’ve said they don’t open internships until January. I’m just worried maybe I’m just not finding out about the ones I wouldn’t know about. 
[deleted]
I would rather have a third than be outright rejected!
I actually am moving on to the hiring committee. Now I only have to worry about it being a "no" from them or all of the spots for sophomores filling up by review date of 11/29
Aww, I'm sorry. Maybe it differs slightly between EP and SWE. :(
what do you think went wrong?

Oh okay, how was the phone interview?
Oh ok, how was the phone interview?
Talent has been leaving Dropbox in droves if you check LinkedIn. Culture at Stripe seems really fantastic. 
Hey it has been over a week, still no reply from them. When did you get the decision from fb after 2nd interview?
Sad to hear that. All the best for your internship hunt. Fingers crossed.
Yea, just finished. Didn't get all the test cases. :/
Damn really? I was so close to passing all the test cases. :/ I must suck at programming.
did you apply on online? and for internship?
why?
Probably didnt hear back then huh?
[deleted]
Makes sense. I prefer take-home exercises over hackerrank challenges but sometimes the open-endedness and lack of instructions is irritating. I wish I had an offer so that I could drop out of this internship search as well; even waiting in between interview rounds has been stressful.
Yeah, was this after the phone interview?
How long does it take to for the decisions to come out and is are there anymore steps towards getting the internship after the hirevue?
[deleted]
Did you make it past? I solved it but took a while cuz I didn’t know how to change my digits to chars. I got rejected. 

Was there anything you did besides solving it?
did you do the second one? I did, and I managed to screw up the coding part of it
My understanding is that they use some language called k, right?
Did they reach out to schedule an interview with you?
That sucks. Two sigma or citadel? How long did you take to finish?
What company are you talking about?
[deleted]
Did you hear back afterwards? 
Thanks! And are there any other rounds after the video interview?
hi! what were the technical questions you were asked? basic data structures?
Thanks to you as well.  Let me know how it goes.
Thanks for the info. How did you do on the online assessments to get the technical interview?
How did you do on online assessments?
Thanks for the info! Took the assessment a few weeks ago, it was super easy like you said. They just contacted me a couple days ago about scheduling an interview. Good to hear your interview wasn't too rough! Did you accept the offer? 
How long did it take for scheduling the interview after you filled up the form with your availability?
[deleted]
what are they asking this sample?
The first one I passed 7/7 and the second one I passed 5/7, still not exactly sure why I didn’t pass those test cases.

It wasn’t as easy as people say, the first question was pretty hard and was a bit finding unique string subsets. The second one was alright/ it depends how good you are with recursion. It was pretty much a more complicated tree sim question 
under 2 weeks like everyone else said, you gotta calm down bro
Update : I gave my OA2 on 25th and got the interview scheduling email today. You should be expecting it anytime now
Nope, I got questionnaire for a summer one and haven't/never heard back.
I have given my OA2 on March 4. Still waiting for interview.
You are totally right. I hate hard conversations but who doesn’t? Im going to buck up and do it tomorrow. Thank you for replying. Happy cake day!
i deferred summer to fall & got a link to HM already

was disorganized on their end though so I'm really not too clear on what's happening despite comms w/ the recruiter
[deleted]
[deleted]
around a week... they sent an email just saying that i moved on to the next round and then another to actually schedule the times few days later
Also still waiting -- had mine on Wednesday
Are you saying it would be better to apply in January compared to now? If so can you give more details into how that works
There isn’t a next time, imma junior. The next summer I will graduate. 
Would the hashing function just be a random number?
they have a question bank
I have some interest in PM but I don’t know if that’s enough to justify forgoing another opportunity 
For both it took me two weeks, but Google’s process was expedited because I had an offer from Microsoft by the time I interviewed with them. 
Got referred 2 months ago and still nothing
About 20 days
exactly, shouldve just accepted one as a safety and reneged if u got something better.
Yeah actually wtf this is nuts lmao
Top school & unicorn internship must do work
My school and previous internship opened a lot of doors for me (which I'm super lucky and thankful for). I also network a lot, both through networking events and computer science charity events. I made a linkedin this year which helped, and also I had a lot of luck on Jumpstart (most companies who reached out via jumpstart said they liked my answers to jumpstarts personality quiz sections, where I talked a lot about my personal ethics and motivations for being in computer science). I hope that helps! Lmk if I can answer anything else!
I didn't expect that either, I just believe in trying to put as much information out there as possible to help level the information gaps. I know when I was starting out I had no idea what to do to get an internship (still have imposter syndrome), so I was just trying to do that. I apologize if anyone took it a wrong way. 
Stripe! Sorry forgot to say that! 
[deleted]
I think my resume is alright, it got me an interview with Google and a couple others.
:(
How did your interviews go? Got an offer?
I did the hackerrank already if that’s what your interested in 
Wow can I dm?
I got my interview call 2 weeks after OA2.
while I'm sure it's true, it's kinda crazy how a lot of people got both of them right when to me they were pretty hard questions (without trying to sound cocky i consider myself a pretty smart dude)...I conceptually understood how to do the first one but was pretty lost for the second. How are you guys able to be successful on these? Is it just practicing leetcode
did you end up doing the first actual interview by any chance? if so how did it go
Toronto - but I already accepted something else. BTW based on your post history, you go to the same university as me - and the same class (CPSC 317) LOL
[deleted]
Ohh hard luck..

Genuine question, what would emailing these people do for you?
Thanks man! You're a life saver
Why would you just drop their emails out in public like that... 
is it not truly? it's alr march, im quite surprised to hear AMZN spots hvnt filled up
Well that's pretty disappointing to hear on their part. Sorry about that man.
How long did they take to get back? I had one Tuesday and I'm not really sure how it went lol
Hey do you know when you found out you got the OA1 last year?

&#x200B;
No idea. I probably didn't pass their coding challenge anyways, my solution timed out on question #3 for a few of them.
Not yet, I submitted mine last friday and the recruiter said if I dont hear back this week then it probably means they're not proceeding. hbu?
what were you guys building, a web app?
phone
Yeah it was that. How long does it take to hear back? Because it took 1 month to get the HireVue invitation after HackerRank, I dont want to wait another month :D
Any thoughts?

&#x200B;
I completed Amazon OA and still not heard back. How long did it take?
Yup it says “application submitted”, it’s the same with Microsoft too
I did it 3 weeks ago. How'd you do on the hackerrank?
Developer summer analyst 
2 rounds where I had 2 questions each. 1st round was 2 medium/easy questions and 2nd round 1 medium and 1 hard.
I haven't, but someone in another thread said he contacted a recruiter, and they were swamped with applications. That was over 3 weeks ago though.
A female friend of mine got Audible's Hackerrank through Grace Hopper conference mailing list. Not sure if it's available for male applicant though.
Did you pass all test cases?  What's the phone screen? Just leetcode stuff?
How'd you find it? Do you know if the challenge is sent to everyone or...?
I’m pretty sure their interns get more, but correct me if I’m wrong. 
I feel like I've never seen Glassdoor have correct numbers on anything lol
As far as I can tell, glassdoor didn't mention stock for 2 sigma new grad
Topic? Graph? 
Which coding challenge number did you get?
Did you get the rejection email too?
Thanks!!! 
I completed months ago, probably early September I think. And I bombed the second questions so not sure why they’re barely contacting me. Might be a different branch. Because I know the NY branch stopped looking for SWE. 
rejected from fbu already? when i submitted my app mid november it said they only start reviewing apps on december 3rd, maybe i'm misremembering.
I got rejected 2 months ago very funny considering they’re “rolling”
where do they tell you that you got rejected? i haven't gotten any emails 
Oh nice.
Have you heard back?
Damn u soph too? I applied and haven't heard back about an OA or anything. Heard from a redditer that they prob don't take second years. 
Nice. When did u do it and have they gotten back to u
So no chance at all? Sorry for my ignorance but from what I understand companies tend to hire interns only if they will go back to school for at least six months after their internships. So is it still possible for me to get any internships in the summer next year at all?
Compensation is competitive. Not sure about entire tech stack but I'd be writing Scala which I'd be happy to learn. Teams have not been confirmed yet but I put in a preference for product. I'm not too excited but I like the high impact. I think I would only renege for G/F/top unicorns.
Hackerrank was a bunch of multiple choice conceptual questions, and a couple of reasonably simple programming questions. LC meds I would say.
Yeah, had to implement the vector class with some basic functions.
Did they ever end up getting back to you? 
Can you please tell me the name of the employee who replied?
[deleted]
Undergrad at a top 15 CS school, have one FAANG internship, mediocre GPA, tons of projects.

Anyways, do you know anyone who has done this interview before? 
How does that work out? 
perhaps does even having one work in your favor though, cuz it looks like you put in more effort? like if they see one is attached but don't bother opening it anyway
Could describe like difficulty level and what topics/algos were tested?
Hope you hear back soon!
[deleted]
What the fuck for real? did they ask you a lot of super specific questions like that too? 
Make sure you know how to do bitwise operations
How can you sort by this on Leetcode?
[deleted]
Which programming language did you use if you don't mind me asking? 
Did you hear back after taking the amazon OA2, if so how long did it take since completion of it?
Did you get an offer / move onto the next round? 
was it only hashmap questions or also included graphs and tree traversals 
Did they give you your set interview date? 
Could be next week. Don't give up hope
From what I've seen, you would have been rejected very soon after OA2 (like 3 days or less). You might be/are probably on the next wave of interviews. Keep preparing!
Yeah I'll keep you posted. Anyone else in the same boat now/had prior experience in this kinda situation?
Throughout next week. what about you?
Good to know someone else is in the same boat. Your dates were for next week, right?
I guess this mightve happened. They shouldve replied with the actual available slots, shouldnt they?
[deleted]
Sorry for the questions but just wondering are you a sophomore? Also how did you do OA1, OA2, and the interview? Heard they take into account OA1 and OA2 when making a final decision
I have not gotten a response yet
All behavioral 
thank you so much, you helped me not to give up. 
Thanks! I'm in the same boat (non-URM unranked CS).

They are still arranging my interviews. I am planning to have it in early-mid December and gonna spend the next month grinding Leetcode + CTCI. 

Good luck! 
Unfortunately, I haven't heard back from the SWE internship either.

I applied the day applications opened. 
 I don't see any openings on Robinhoods page anymore 
Googles mostly done tbh
Still hiring. A friend got an email to schedule an interview yesterday
Thanks, you as well! I’m annoyed though, I was expecting an email by 10 days after I took the assessment, which was this last Friday. On Friday, I got an email from Amazon in class but they just resent the same email confirming that I completed the assessment.
About a month later, I submitted my application in mid-late December and got the first OA1 January 18th.
How hard were the questions in terms of leetcode difficulty?
I'm pretty sure they check the output (stdout) of the solution and compare to the right answer. At least that what happened whenever I ran the test cases. And if that's true then, I'm already filtered out....
I don't really remember anymore, sorry :( I didn't understand most of them. There were 9 questions though, with a mix of high level / low level 
Than you very much for your reply, I send them an email but till now there is no answer, I hope they respond to me soon, anyway thank you again :)
Either bruh
Do you have to submit the hackerrank for an internship? I just submitted the application for Twitter Academy but there was no mention for a hackerrank,
No I meant just the HackerRank
Thanks tho!
I applied on 27 September, so about 2 weeks
I honestly do not know how are they like as I’m an incoming cs undergrad. I thought this is a serious thread? 
I heard back about 9 hours after taking the exam
[deleted]
Two weeks.
Two weeks
Lmao
will they let me use python for the virtual interview part ? 
Hm, probably a returning intern thing. afaik the max offer was 48/hr (sampling non-returning interns) despite having significantly higher offers. 
How poorly?
Nice! That's good to hear. What was your first question like?
Is it Waterloo? What year are you in?
How was the technical question? I've heard that they ask about projects etc for 20 mins, and then ask one 10 min easy-ish technical question but that its rushed. How was your experience? 
Hey 
Did you get the offer letter yet? 

The third is to make up for your 1 weaker interview. US students don’t do onsites, congratsss.
Oh Jesus, at least it was quick and without worry. I guess.
[deleted]
Did you have to fill out a second survey first? Or did you go immediately to the interview
It was a bank that's talked a lot about here (don't want irl friends to spot me). Feelsbadman
Thanks! I totally feel you on the internship applications burn out, sorry :(

FWIW, I saw another person mentioning they felt they did good but got rejected here too: https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9qm5d3/reddit_internship/e8cqz6j/

[deleted]
I had to look that shit up
So for the code debugging, were they like syntax errors? Or logic applied incorrectly, or big errors like using wrong DS or Something?
It's probably your resume that needs some work then. 

However go to linkedin -> 'software engineer', United States -> filter: 24 hours & internship -> APPLY TO ALL OF THEM
Yeah I think that’s accurate, I couldn’t even think of how to quantify it. And honestly idk if that’s worth it. Like even barely being in class and all. At the end of the day it realistically shouldn’t be like this. More power to em tho. 
It's possible to move on with 3/7, depends on how you did with the logic part.
Most likely means we didn't get it. Most successful people got it 1-2 weeks. Howd your oa2 go?
Hey do you know the time span between getting the OA1 and OA2 and the interview?

&#x200B;
Pay for first time interns is 7650, last year it was higher I thought
What was it last year? That's what it is this year
Do you have to compile your code?
Any tips on how you prepared for these tests? I can't even land 1 offer :( 
Link to the LeetCoder app?
Congrats on the offers! I'm curious if you've thought about whether fall recruiting might be more difficult while doing an internship at the same time? I'm thinking of doing the same with fb but the recruiting thing is holding me back a bit.
Do you know if Facebook can push internship to spring 2019 at this time?
> No sorry, I don't have a redacted version :( 

Then spend 2 minutes and make one? Your post isn't actually helping anyone without it. You also broke the rule:

>All top-level comments should contain a link to a currently (at the time of posting) open internship application page.
> No sorry, I don't have a redacted version :( 

Then spend 2 minutes and make one? Your post isn't actually helping anyone without it. You also broke the rule:

Something like balanced brackets?
was it similar to the other two?
Wait, isn't there a hiring committee in between interview and host matching? Also, can I ask what was your process in getting interviews -- did you just apply through their websites?
Was it the virus one?
Wow just one medium? That's surprising 
Haha as a matter of fact I have a FB NYC return offer this summer. It's definitely more competitive so your application needs to have stood out. Not much you can do now but wait though. As a second choice, I'd reccomend seattle over MPK.
No problem! Thanks for sharing! So I accepted FB for fall too :-) Do you know which office you'll be working at?
Thank you for your input
Awesome, congrats! 
Google rejected me from Fall 2019 on the grounds that I'm still in project match for Winter. Their system seems kind of broken considering it's winter and I am not working nor will I have an offer for Google in the next 4 months. 
Mind if I get  copy as well. would like some guidance on what to do right. Were these mainly from uni or from a careerboard like indeed/linkedin?
My final round is in two weeks so maybe their just waiting to finish interviewing everyone’s
Lmao I already signed with someone else. Imma do the interview anyways for practice. 
Smh same, they responded like a month after my deadline for another offer so I took the offer I had. 
Does the 2 leveled online assessment of Amazon is a video recorded assessment ? 
Does everyone get the online assessment? 
Where would such data come from? 
[deleted]
I started late August.
AFAIK, they're not aware of it, all the immigration stuff is handled by me or the university. As long as I can get paid, I'm good. I'm just in for the experience, I've heard they treat their interns very well. However, cap1 is probably not where I want to end up since the full time compensation is not really up to par with other companies.
so they have team specific interviews too? for internship?
How did you go about getting several papers published before/Junior year?
That's what I'm guessing. Bloomberg's hiring bar may be slightly higher, but Amazon is such a big name that it would help a lot for resume screenings/recruiters. If this is your last summer internship I would go with Bloomberg, otherwise Amazon, but its almost marginal.
The 1st internship (especially in freshman year) definitely helps immensely in terms of not getting ghosted / past the resume screen. I remember my 2nd year applying for internships went a lot more smoothly than the first.

Congrats!
I used Handshake and LinkedIn 
WHOA what?? I heard they paid like, $25/hr with a small housing stipend or something.. that's a huge bump! Congrats, hope you have a blast
[deleted]
Guess we’re all in a similar boat. Let me know how your guys go. Good luck!
How do you know we'll hear back on Monday?
Well I didn't hear back
yes
Damn I went like 0/7 in debugging and probably got 85% for the other part so probably doesn’t mean anything 
Nah I'm just playin
\_/\\\_  \_/\\\_  Great Profile!
Would it be possible to see anon version of your resume? I have a similar profile but unfortunately very little bites. 
Yeah, okay so you are junior now, makes sense.
Thanks, appreciate it!

EDIT: Funnily enough, I just checked my application status and the status changed from "Recruiter review" to "Applied".
I have a video interview, any tips?
I would take some time to gather your thoughts before you record your answer. You have unlimited time, so maybe write down a few bullet points or something. It’s just a behavioral interview, so it won’t be too bad.
Same here. I applied to them through a career fair a week ago, but I haven't received a response yet
Nothing.
Well, I wish you the best of luck! It sucks that it seems like you can get screwed over for doing too well :( I'm glad you don't have to interview again, and maybe we might end up in the same area in the summer :D

My situation seems somewhat different because I've been forwarded to the SWE recruiters while still being considered for EP. I'm not sure what to make of it; it almost seems like they're out of spots (even though they're screening freshman now) geared towards first/second year students? It's weird though because there's plenty of EP interns who have lot's of experience (past internships, teaching, research, hackathon projects) but get to do EP. She said I could rescind myself from the SWE consideration process but I'm not sure how that will effect the EP one.
Mine was in NYC and I spoke to couple people on Reddit and it seems like most of them didn't get any technical questions for the last round. Like one of my friends went a week before me and he got 0 technical questions. But I was asked a rather odd math problem that didn't have anything to do with coding tbh. 
Maybe post your resume on the critique threads or send it to your career center and see what feedback you get
Just curious, do you start in January at Apple for soc systems position? Congrats btw.
Yeah it's weird as hell
Yes, I can send a screenshot over PM if you want
Thank you and good luck on the rest of the process! Mine might have been sped up a little bit because of a competing deadline but hopefully they’ll get back to you soon!
Same boat as you. Just had an interview today and first problem was unconventional with a really weird edge case I tripped up on . Second one wasn’t bad at all. Weird! Hopefully good news for both of us!
That’s so cool! I’m glad your last minute studying went great! Any hints about company? What type of questions were you asked? 
oh, welp
Great ! All the best :) 
I passed
Did you apply to the US or Canadian one if you don't mind me asking. I'm a bit cheesed cause I applied on the 8th of October for the Kitchener one and still didn't hear back as a URM freshman lmao. 
Yep 
Same, the questions didn't seem hard but by the time I was able to process what the question was asking it was time to move on to the next one! Hope they weigh the logic portion heavily
The first question I got all test cases passing. The second question I only got one test case to pass. They gave two test cases per question but your code is tested against more than those
USA 
Awesome! I loved working in NYC. Ive had a lot of friends intern there, they have a lot of really cool tech talks for their interns, so I would def recommend you check that out!
Right thanks.
Thanks for the reply!
I'm curious what your resume looked like for you to land 3 internships as a freshman (I assume).
Lol I saw someone who heard back a year later with a generic rejection 
any luck so far?
Yes and yes
Yup! But I'm not complaining! I just wish there were more companies hiring at the same scale as amazon !! 😂😂
Oh... Well that’s a fat yikes
Yeah figured as much. Normally takes a bit longer as per other semesters
TIL. I guess it depends for that person then, internships you don't sign anything and are in limbo
i see.. I would probably email ur recruiter kindly asking if they got the information they needed - just to remind them and in case theres an issue with anything.
about a week ago, applied around 2 weeks before that
Just heard back from applying online
It's for host matching if you get past HC I believe 
Got it before. 
My recruiter emailed me to tell me
Don't lose hope, I know that the recruiter has been busy these few weeks travelling and processing other applications.
all the best. I did 1 week back. How was your interview? Did you solve all questions?
i dont know if it actually works, thats just the advice ive read on like cscareeradvice on similar threads. 
Could you explain a bit more what the code review was like? I've never heard of that before.
Maybe they thought less people would get it. I know I got like 10 out of 12 cases, cause I fell for the 2 test cases where it was like 2 middles and I didn't understand why it was wrong.         
Or they hoped they could have more people do it or something to not get discouraged when it takes an hour or 2. 
No
No
yes
I interviewed at the start of December, which was probably a week after I did my coding challenge. Interview was mostly about past projects and related experience.
[deleted]
Damn well good luck with the others, the only response I had gotten was for battle.net I believe. 
Didn’t make it to the next round 
Yeah pretty much all the Big 4's and a couple of Big N's. I don't know if that changes anything but we are from a top Canadian University so that probably helped.
The usual. Arrays, Trees, Graphs, Hashmaps

Interview's scheduled for next week
Did you have any interview before that or that was directly after the OA2?
I realized now that it did say “amazon offer” in the picture but I didn’t see it till now haha.
How was the coding challenge they sent you?
Hirevue was 2 LC easy, and the on-campus was mostly behavioral and talking about my experience.
[deleted]
ah that's why. i think Snap only lets you "apply" to their internships when they have campus events at certain target schools. did you have referrals to airbnb/lyft/dropbox as well?
[deleted]
Lol wtf
About two or three weeks after. I also applied for a PM internship so it might be a bit different
Nah it’s pretty standard, be prepared to go in depth about your projects 
Sweet let’s set it up soon.
I can second that advice, that was how I prepared (plus some HackerRank questions) and I felt it was sufficient for my EP interviews. 

Especially review data structures and searching/sorting.
Both US and Canada. Hoping for a US office placement tho. I'm really hoping EP works out so don't have to go back on the application grind.
That's great to hear! Hope you get an offer! I have my interviews for EP tmrw!  How difficult were the questions - leetcode easy medium? Now that you are the more experienced one, any last minutes tips haha
Turns out I mixed up my fintech companies and I was thinking about Plaid instead of Stripe. Stripe's on-site is different but well documented online though (there's a bug-hunting one, very different from typical interviews). I do know they asked me to confirm my preferred coding language, though. 
Yea I made it to host-matching :). Not sure how to feel at this step though, but just hoping to get lucky.
I actually interviewed on the 9th. My guess is that you'll hear back soon, but if not you should probably ask your recruiter about it (which is what I did shortly before hearing back, but I have no idea if it changed anything).
Thanks a lot. I have received the coding challenge. It has two parts, programming assignment and math challenge. 
They were fine, first one was behavioral and second was a 45 minute technical interview. The question was one I haven't gotten before but it wasn't absurdly hard, I thought it was overall a good and fair process.
Part of it is that they schedule the two technical interviews back to back while most other companies will take time to evaluate the first before inviting you for a second, so the interview process being short kind of makes up for the wait being long.
I'm in a similar position. After my tech interviews, I got a call the very last Friday of September where my recruiter explained how the project selection stuff works. She also said there would probably be radio silence for a good while because projects were still being approved. I just don't know how long "a good while" is and it scares me. Reading everyone else's responses makes me feel better about myself though.
I said so bc i was so confident i did really well.. now im super depressed
Gotcha thanks for the info!
Ahhh, thanks so much!!! Congrats on your offer :) 
EP candidates go through host matching as well, but since they are given offers first a match is guaranteed
There are so many duplicate summer 2019 intern positions. Do you know which one you applied to?
I completed the OA on October 11th
Just got an email to schedule a phone interview next to next week
Was that for Amazon Canada as well? How hard were the interviews?
Same position as you. How'd you prep for it? Would doing LC easy just be be enough?

Also, I'm not sure how googles coder thing works, but say you're using c++, are you able to import a linked list or nodes? 
Yea go for it
Nope, just filled out the application and radio silence for months.
How much time and how many problems did you have?

I just finished OA1 today
yeah that was very likely it lol. the response was like instant
Thanks, anyways I did the interview and got the offer last week, still cant believe it
For some reason I just now got this notification and really wish I would have saw it before the test lol but thank you man
My friend was asked to write in C++ / C/ Java.
Email.
I didn't find it super challenging. In leetcode terms probably an easy then medium question. Make sure that you know all the common data structures and and common ways to use them. It can be very helpful.
I've got mine coming up in an hour and half, good luck to you!!
I didn't certainly rock the interview, It was okayish. 
wow.... most of my friends who have already taken the virtual interview told me they only got 1 leetcode easy or 2 leetcode easy's at most... guess it really depends on who's interviewing you o.O
Are you a junior / senior?
Ahhh nice! Also when did you hear back after phone?
SRS question. How do you get down a dp problem that you've never seen before, I can't do it
Where did they reach out from? LinkedIn?
Nope. Just said that I had another offer. The deadline for my offer is actually in late December, but it's a first come first serve kinda thing so I told them that 
I got it 3 days after passing my technical interview! I think it's different for TPM though bc they need to match you to a project early in the process before going forward. 
SRE isn't lower tier compare to SWE especially at a company like LinkedIn. You should do more research into the role and what they do at major companies before saying that. You have some great offers man! 
Mongo's stock has been doing exceptionally well this year, and was barely touched by the recent downturn. Its in use and very important at many large firms, and makes a lot of money.
Do you know what the matching process is like for sophomores that don't have a return offer (but previous internship experience)? Like do most people get matched? Any tips?
Did they email you or did you have to check through the Amazon student portal? Just curious because I applied as well haha, good luck! 
Softheon
Yeah I'm scheduling a phone screen with them this week. I'm surprised to be honest, based on my assessment performance...
I'm in a large group chat with a bunch of cs people, and a lot of them applied to FBU. Someone asked yesterday if anyone's heard back from FB, and 8 people replied saying that they haven't heard back from them yet. No one said anything about interviews or offers. I haven't heard of anyone that's had a positive follow up from FBU yet.
ohh that's a good point.  

and thank you! :') I applied very last minute lol - day of the deadline with about 10 minutes to spare. 
(repost from another comment)
I heard back from EP today (10/24) to schedule interviews. I applied 9/25 and I am a sophomore white male from a "top" 200 CS program. 

Don't lose hope if you haven't been rejected yet! I think my "diversity" part was what set me apart-- that I'm from a rural community (sold it better in the essay than this comment lol). Good luck!
Nah they are constantly sending out new interview invites, dw until they send a rejection email
Hiring committee
My recruiter said Monday
it takes more than two weeks to get back the result
Hmm I had completely different questions then.
I was asked for a third last year, got the internship, and this year I have a returning SWE intern offer from Google! Don't stress. 
Idk honestly first interviewer was 15min late so we had to rush through the interview and i think that set me back a bit. 2nd interview from my point of view was great. 
I didn't take it (I had already accepted an offer), so I unfortunately don't know.
[deleted]
A few hours after actually. Mainly because I was friends with my recruiter and Dm'd him to get my feedback quick 
Thanks dude, I have an offer already from JP Morgan but I'm trying to get into the Big N lol. I'm waiting for my Google interview results and gonna start Amazon soon. Good luck to you as well!
what did they ask?
I got the completing parentheses question which I found easy. `)(()` -> `()(())`.
You can always renege later if need be. You can also use this offer as a bargaining chip to help speed up other companies' interview processes.
I did the hackerrank yesterday so not yet maybe
[deleted]
For me there weren't any steps after and I heard back 2-3 weeks after!
Should I feel bad that I still haven't gotten an OA...
Did you do the first or second one?
I ran out of time due to being rusty at syntax, but I commented what I would have done and talked about it in the next video response question.

It's been about a week since I did it and haven't heard back, so I don't know what that means but I'm not very hopeful. Kicking myself for messing up such an easy coding challenge! 
yup. The interviewer's responses to questions reflected the Glassdoor reviews pretty well I thought.
Yes. I have one scheduled for Jan 16th
Two sigma and it took about an hour and 30 minutes out of the 3 hours they give you. 
Coinbase. They apparently didn’t cancel the program though or it got brought back.
Shoot, I stand corrected. Thanks for the heads up though, I have mine coming up as well
Yeah but took 2 months
If this is for the intern role, no, I think that's it! Not sure about new grad.
uhh first one i think i did good. second one i bombed but somehow got the phone interview. but i really bombed the phone interview LOL
did well on first one, bombed second one but still got the phone interview
Turned it down, but good luck to you :)
Filled out the form 2/18, got my interview time confirmation at the end of the day 2/20
Canada in general.
[deleted]
Ah I see, so I guess they are just sending it to everyone that did the coding challenge then...
[deleted]
Hey I'm in the host matching phase since 2 months now (lol). I don't think this is gonna work out. What did you have to tell your recruiter to defer it to fall? Do they accommodate the request easily?
Did you get a reply? I did my coding sample two weeks ago, but I still haven't heard back yet
This was actually my second interview ever (after a rejection from Microsoft). I found it useful to do some of the LeetCode problems just for some confidence but my actual question wasn’t that related to them imo. I’d brush up on the leadership principles and prepare some stories though, cause that’s what my interview started with. I think I did well though. We’ll see!
In January lots of companies open up new listings for the same position. I'm not sure how recruiting works but I think now if you apply you'll be at the back of the all the other applications, I'm not super sure tho
It doesn't have to be complicated. You can just mod the size of the array. You would also need to maybe talk about collision solutions.
This is relieving, I've heard people saying they waited around 10 and I got really worried. Thank you!
I feel too bad to do that..
[deleted]
What did you think helped make you stand out the most when first job hunting and landing the unicorn? You mentioned not having any personal projects or practicing leetcode but you've definitely found a lot of success in the interview process. 
I think I'll just post it so it's public.

Dear Mr/Ms [INSERT NAME],

My Name is [NAME] and I'm a [YEAR][MAJOR] major at [INSERT SCHOOL]. I just wanted to reach out to you and express how interested I am in pursuing a [INSERT TITLE] internship role at [COMPANY] for the summer of 2019. I applied online a while back but I haven't heard anything since then. I believe I have some relevant qualifications for the role and I would love to have an opportunity to Interview with you. Thank you so much for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you. I've attached my resume to this email in case you might ever want to see it. Thank you again.

Sincerely, [NAME]

attach resume
For sure! 
That’s great but google isn’t the most selective when it comes to resumes lol. The big 4 aren’t very selective at that stage in my experience. Might still be worth getting it checked cuz a 0 response rate is worrisome especially considering that someone emailed about the same amount of people as you and got interviews with 10+.
I just had mine not too long ago, so I'm not sure. Probably going to hear back some time next week (at least that's what they told me).
How was it? What type of problems and difficulty 
yeah for sure :) 
One question was easy medium, but the second one was literally more towards the harder side as it involved like 2-3 concepts

I guess practice is the key....I literally used to fail the first few coding challenges, but gradually improved a lot, also I am a grad student so during my undergrad I used to do hackerrank and these type of sites for interviews back home, that definitely helped 

You can practice some questions with one of your peers too and get to know the coding styles of others

BTW what language do you code in
Hey, the questions you got, were they leetcode tagged?  
Also, can you tell the type of the questions? A friend of mine did OA2 with flying colours, and the questions were pretty straightforward, given you know your hashmaps and little bit of graphs traversals. 
like the phone interview

&#x200B;
LOL I'm not in cpsc 317. What job did you accept instead?
I set up my interview from 12-1pm but I was using my school email. My University is in the Midwest , thus the time was registered for 10:00 instead 12, and I am currently interning at Linkedin in Sunnyvale, so I was late and the rejected for missing the interview. Feelsbadman.jpeg
Hard a knock life, brother...It's a hard a knock life.
Bring you to the front of line and get you application to seen by a human instead of applying online. I got all my interviews from emailing. From top Companies like Airbnb, Pinterest, Facebook, Snap, Google, Two Sigma...etc
think when I had it took like 2-3 days to hear back? depends I guess
I got 2/4 of the questions, it was stupid hard, what about you?

Final round for me was two back to back video interviews.  And then offer.
Yeah, I passed all the test cases. The phone screen is definitely Leetcode/problem-solving sort stuff. Just one question. I was pretty upfront that I hadn't taken OS yet and didn't get grilled on that.
I think they sent it to everyone, anyone confirm they haven’t received it? 

Also, haven’t done it yet 
I found it leetcode easy but I suck bc I didn't get all the test cases to pass.
It's a hedge fund. It doesn't have stock.
Mine was an odd game simulation problem. There was a bit of string parsing but the rest was just to simulate the game accurately.
It's #4
No, just checked online on amazon.jobs
Oh ! is it ? But you have to apply separately for each of the branches right ? Anyways All the best man! Rock it!
Whoops I actually got the letter December 3rd @ 2:28 pm, a day after the apps closed. I misremembered, sorry for the confusion. 
They email you no matter what. I got it through mine, the recruiter was actually very nice about it. Hope you make it! 
No, i pass all the test cases tho. Have you?
There's a girl at my school who did it in her second year, so we can hope.
Exactly 1 month ago and have not heard back
No, you're 100% good, just apply (I meant those who graduate in May 2020). It makes no difference as long as you go back to school after the internship, in fact it probably looks better since you can start working earlier. I graduate in December 2019 and got plenty of interviews and secured an offer.  I assume you're talking about this upcoming 2019 summer.
Sounds like you should accept it then. If a unicorn or big N comes around then accept that instead. Tell them you received an offer you couldn't refuse. Fall 2019 is still a long ways away.
Hope you did well. Was there any OS related questions?
Yes they just emailed me yesterday to schedule a phone interview. A week later than HR told me I would be contacted.
Mine was about an hour. If I had to guess, I'd say they probably have 2 coding questions for you over the phone. 
i see thanks and sorry don't know anyone
LC-med I would say. There was also a design section in addition to the 2 also problems.
Not really, just that my recruiter switched. Im working in the Seattle office so they arent sure what teams will be there this summer yet.
Yeah he was pretty bummed out. Nah, they barely even looked at my resume because they had their own unrelated questions they wanted to ask but I guess on average it is somewhere in the middle of these 2 scenarios
Under the Problems tab, beside the search bar is a "Lists" button. Click that.
I never listed my CC. To be honest though I only went there for two semesters and the school I was transferring to was the school I got my first degree from. So my GPA was the same. I would list your CC on the resume along with your GPA if it is good. I would then list the school you plan on transferring to above it and the intended graduation date.
C++ for both.
Still waiting to hear back, it’s been almost 2 weeks now. For reference I passed all test cases and felt like I did fairly well for oa1
I took it yesterday. So, no I haven't heard back yet.
Nope. I'd imagine they will wait until everyone puts in their availability.
There isn't any specific thing you need to say. Just be polite and professional, and that you are sorry you have to go back on your word. Whether or not you give a reason is up to you, but I wouldn't lie and say it's because of a medical or health issue
[deleted]
yeah, from Monday through Friday. I’m kinda worried because I don’t know if they usually send information out on the weekends, and today is Friday. Please keep me posted if you do hear back!
Yeah, I'm a sophomore. I got a 4/7 for debugging in OA1, passed all test cases in OA2, and did fairly well on the interview. Not too sure how this plays in, but I also applied to Amazon Canada.
Yikes, somehow that’s scarier to me than having all technical interviews. It’s really difficult to demonstrate your worth as an engineer without actually showing your engineering skills in practice, and if you’re like me and don’t really like talking about yourself or being the center of attention then it can be a little intense. But these companies obviously want someone who’s well rounded and I guess this is a good way to gauge that.
Completed yesterday. It will be hard to wait without knowing anything for at least weeks. Out of curiosity, what is their expected level in this? Should the candidate answer smartly and fluently?
Awesome! Lmk if you need to do a mock interview with someone
Yeah, not sure what are they doing. Couple people said that they got a resume rejection. But I haven't heard anyone talking about interviews.
Don't think so, host matching is still ongoing. A lot of people didn't get matched until Feb/March last year.
I just got contacted by google ~2 weeks ago and am in the middle of the process right now so I don’t think they’re done (unless they’re wasting their time by interviewing me)
a freshman or nah?

&#x200B;
easy
How many were you able to solve and was the time enough ? They have given around 5 hours but expect us to complete in 2, is it do able in 2 hrs ? 
[deleted]
PM
I believe they send the hackerrank about a week later? 
Wait I literally just got it. When they say we have 7 days to complete it, does that mean we can open and close it throughout the week or does it have to be done in one sitting?
It's different for different companies, but generally they won't be easy. It's one of the ways they filter candidates to try and find the best ones, so generally the top tier companies will have more difficult interview questions. 
USA.
have you completed your interview with amazon for SD intern?
That's a long time lol damn 
I didn't get a solution to the single question asked in time, partly because I didn't fully understand the concepts behind it. It was a weighted random number generator. I believe I got the third interview because I did really well on the other phone interview.
Hmm, just a bunch of string manipulation and palindrome questions. It was pretty easy, honestly.
Nope! It's a tiny Atlantic Canadian university not known for CS. I am entering my 4th year of a 5 year co-op program.
Sorry, I misunderstood the question. I thought you meant the *Microsoft* campus, for onsites. My first round was over the phone, where I was asked some behavioral questions and a brain teaser. I don't know what an on-campus screen would be be like.
Yeah quite long ago 
Edited :) Thanks!
I mean, yeah, I was expecting it after the way it went so I was mostly amused at the speed lmao
technical
The problems I got were all very reasonable and some of them were quite fun. I had a few list-based DP problems but none that were too difficult to suss out the solution to. Interviewers were very friendly and helpful if I started to head in the wrong direction.
I don’t remember any syntax errors because everything compiled. Imagine a function that should return the sum of everything in the array but instead it returns the length of the array. Most of the fixes are quick
Yeah honestly it isn't worth devoting this much time. I'm honestly super try-hard and grinded hard for a few big N offers, but 1500+ hours is fucking ridiculous
I just got my invitation for the interview 15 minutes ago. Have hope!

I had all test cases pass on OA2
OA1-OA2: about a week
OA2-interview: about two weeks
interview-offer: two business days
really? i thought it was the same as last year. i’m probably wrong tho 
Last yr it was 2500/mo in Seattle and this yr it's 3500, so it's kinda a bump.....also they have upped bay area/NYC salaries to 8450/month which is more than Facebook, google and Microsoft 
no
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/leetcoder/id1069760709
Thanks! To be honest, yeah I thought about it. I would've preferred to push back my offer to the winter, but Facebook wouldn't let me without re-interviewing. I'm okay with the fall though, I'm hoping to get a return internship offer from Google and just do host matching instead of recruiting.
No idea, sorry. 
How about no
Yep, you got it!
They didn't ask me for a third interview; but yes, it's supposed to be similar to the other two.
Yes. I got past it? 

Yes, but I also got referred.
yep
Yeah I think I got lucky.
Fuck :( ok good to know. My recruiter put in a bid for me but he mentioned returning interns get priority. I thought since I’m doing Fall 2019 there would be less people interning though = less competition.

Why Seattle over MPK? I think I’m going to choose Seattle anyway, but I’m just wondering.
Oh awesome! I'll be in Seattle
Damn sorry dude :/ 
I’m about to go to sleep but I’ll definitely get a version for you guys tomorrow. They were all through online applications. I had 0 referrals and didn’t go through my university whatsoever, but it definitely helps to have an insider. Last year I got some on-site interviews directly at small, local companies through my career fair.




tho I’m bout to attend my career fair this year in a t shirt 
Mind letting me know what they ask you? I'm interviewing with them soon too.
No, not for me at least. The first level was debugging and stuff, and the second was a coding exercise (two coding questions).
No
Purely anecdotal. Datapoints could be gathered from friends. Just wanted to have a general idea of which companies have higher expectation for interns.
I find them with Google or websites like Crunchbase then send them cold-contact emails that are basically a cover letter and a resume. It's actually how I got my first internship the summer after my freshman year (I was an ME major at the time). 
Gotcha that's fair enough and I appreciate the clarification. 
Yeah so at the on-site they split you into groups and you interview for your specific team
Luck and hard work. I started early in high school (was lucky to be accepted to a good summer research program with an excellent mentor who showed me the ropes). Freshman year, I applied to research groups at my University and luckily found a group that matched with my interests and accepted me (I already had a decent publication by that time). I guess I just happened to meet the right people and had time to spend on research. I'm only a co-author on my top publications.
Yeah that's what I'm hoping as well. I'm really excited to get working at this pretty cool startup. I think I'm going to learn a lot of stuff that's going to increase my chances next fall. Thank you!
Haha yeah, I was concerned with the comp too but I guess it was unfounded concerns. Pretty excited and good luck to you too! 
I was reached out to by a recruiter in Sept 5th after attending their Aug 2nd event. The whole process started from there culminating in onsites during October 11th. They mentioned they'd have a second wave of onsites, so be sure to apply fast and try to get in on the second round!

Good luck! They're a brilliant company with competitive pay for the area (plus corporate housing, commute passes, free food, etc).
i've heard from a verified but undisclosable source.
He doesn't 
who is your recruiter?
How long did it take them to get back?
😂😂😂 
Sure. I had to redact a lot to make it anonymous, but hopefully it helps. [Here's the link.](https://imgur.com/a/7rapISW)
same here. Haven’t heard anything from them.
Oooh I see! Good luck with EP -- tbh my recruiter also made it sound like EP was too full to consider me if I got rejected from SWE. It's not the most ideal position to be in. I know people who I would consider much more experienced than me got into EP, so I'm wondering if it's me being too experienced or EP too full to consider me. Oh well, hopefully good things come from the SWE process. Let me know how your process goes! :)
I posted it on cscareerquestions and got positive feedback, and my career office says its pretty good too. It's gotten me interviews at a few other BIg N companies as well as a bunch of smaller local ones. 

The only thing I can think of that would count me out is the fact that, although I had research and a few internships on my resume, I didn't list any projects.
>do you start in January at Apple for soc systems position?

&#x200B;

I'll be starting in January! But for a different team.
any advice on how to politely bug my guy lmao
applied for both, the one I heard back from is US
How long did it take to hear back after your oa2? I just did it, I was able to get all test cases on the first problem, but didn't really start the second other than pseudo code. Sounds like we had the same questions. 
Before last June I had a marketing internship and this remote swe Intern position that I let go a couple weeks later. And the iOS project .
Nope :/
They finally rejected me a couple of days ago :(
Sorry what's HC?
That's reassuring, how long after you filled the form did you get an interview?
How many questions did you guys do? For my first interview I solved 1 and she had a follow up which we didn't really have time to code and so we discussed but I struggled a bit with it. And the second interview it was a difficult question but after he gave me a lot of hints I figured it out and coded the solution 
Damn that's great! It's been 3.5 months for me now.
[deleted]
Good luck to you too! Was there a position with Battle.net in the title? I remember the HackerRank email said it was for Battle.net Client SWE Internship, but I never applied for any position with that in the title.
How did u do on oa2?
I see, thanks for your reply. Good luck on your career!!
Ah all the best then.
Did you have the interview yet? If you had, what topics did it cover? If not how are you preparing?, I will have an interview with Amazon in a few weeks and I'm pretty nervous.
I had a few interviews before that, mostly behavior stuff, the leadership principle stuff. That was my only really technical interview. The interview before that asked my questions about when I encountered certain situations and stuff like that. 
[deleted]
Thanks a lot for reading and replying. Congratulations on the internship. I have DMd you.
Yeah that’s what I heard. Referral from Airbnb/lyft but all my friends got Airbnb hackerranks anyways. Lyft was def because of referral. 
Pretty sure it’s in Atlanta, GA. That’s actually a really decent offer LOL
Ok, it's only been a little more than a week so I'll wait and see. Thanks!
So my recruiter just told me I would have 2 rounds 1 with HR and 1 with Hiring Manager so how were those interviews like?  
how do we do that
Great, thank you :)
Same here! I am so burnt out from applying to places. I just want an offer so I dont have to keep putting in all this effort lol
[deleted]
That’s awesome man! It’s been a week and a half already i am starting to stress for the results . Hopefully you get to work in something cool! Congrats! 
Yeah I already emailed her like 1.5 weeks ago don't want to spam her lol.
Let me know if you hear anything, ill do the same. :P. Btw, around what field are u aiming for (ml, web dev, etc?).
I completed OA on October 14th
Yes and no, was for a subsidiary of theirs or whatever. Wasn't that bad but I completely choked, knew the question but fumbled my words into there being some misunderstandings. Also didn't focus on their values
I guess easy&medium is enough for sample, but can't speak for interview, yet ;)

U can use standard libraries. Idk bout c++ libs, but if they're not additional, u can use them. U won't need extra stuff, though. 
2 problems, 70 minutes, then some work quiz/survey thing that took 10 min. if you get moved on it’ll all be in the email
[deleted]
I got an offer after two weeks! 
yeah, the guy interviewing me was a senior software manager at amazon that had been working there for 8 years

4 years of java and I was defeated by the sliding window
Do you know if they got an offer by any chance?
I'm a junior.
Kind of long, like a week or two. 
It helps me to think of how I would solve it recursively, and from then on see if there are any overlapping calls. You basically need to figure out the dimensions of the memo, what to store, and how to fill it up. Then add in base cases and keep going. 
No, they emailed me. I think the Palantir recruiter was for our school and had my email from some past event I attended on campus. 
Can't help you there unfortunately - like I said above I did EP last year which was also an "offer first, match later" sort of deal. That being said my matching was fairly quick, I only took one call and it was just my host talking about their project / team for 10-15 minutes. YMMV but I'm fairly sure the majority of people match, good luck regardless.
Email
I wonder if not getting an email from Amazon mean that I didn't get passed through resume screening.
Ah nice. I hope I get the test soon. All the best.
Thank you, please reply back if you hear anything, I’ll do the same 
>FBU

did any of them receive an email about continued interest or something cause someone got an email like that
I got for one more intetview. Can I ask you again on monday?
What did u get?
Shot you a reply, I think we had the same questions.
That's a relief... thanks for the assurance!
I am in the same situation right now! I got a request for an additional internview (3rd). I am pretty worried. Is it much harder compared to previous two?

&#x200B;

And I am worried being late for joining the host matching pool. I heard it's better to join asap but my recruiter didnt even give me the date for the third intervew yet :( .  So stressful
Oh okay, Congrats!
Okay. I have to follow up with my recruiter i guess to find the status. Thanks.
Awesome. How was your google interview? I am also waiting for google results.
I got the same but idk why my code wasn’t working for adding the “)”’s at the end. Spent so much time trying to fix this issue. 
people say I can renege later, but is it really true?

Even though I have to sign on DocuSign?
[deleted]
Oh cool...thanks for getting back tho!
I haven't gotten one either
I can’t remember which tbh I just know the problem I got 
I basically did the exact same thing as you (ran out of time, I ran out because I didn't initially realize you had to deal with formatting), haven't heard back yet either
I think they use time as a strong factor. I solved it in 30 minutes and got phone interview -> superday -> rejected.
Depends on the interviewer. Some give behavorial, some ask other stuff. Mine had no behavorial questions.
Damn. Is there an on-site afterwards or a phone interview? 
Hey when did you hear back ?
Ah sorry to hear that. Hopefully they can overlook the bombed ones. What kind of questions did you get for the second one and the phone interview? 
Thanks! Hope you ended up with an opportunity you're excited about :)
It takes time apparently. Give it a week's time. If you've scheduled before that, wait till Monday atleast. 
When did you give OA2? After how many days, did you receive invitation for virtual interview? Also, did they ask you to schedule interviews in the same week when you got the invite or week after that?
what specifically would you like to know?
i just told them i'd already accepted on offer but was wanting to work with them in the fall

and they said no guarantees but they'll try
Thats a mistake. its very early in the year right now as well, so reneging won't be as damaging as reneging in march.

You're missing a few other companies on here that you could try though, like AT&T, IBM, Blizzard (since you like games), Disney (Has started aggressively hiring this year), EA, Riot Games (might get resume rejected, might not) etc.
I wasn't the original post, I just meant they must've had a good unicorn company and just being at a top school overcomes a lot 
I'm not sure I really stood out last year, I applied to around 100 places and only got 3 interview requests. However, I ta an intro course in python and am pretty good at teaching, so whenever I do an interview I just approach it as me teaching that problem to my students (pretending I'm just ill-prepared :) ). This lets me stay really calm and explain my thought process well, and I got offers from all the places I interviewed that year. 
thanks for making it public!


out of curiosity, whats ur username inspired by?
How do you find recruiters' emails?
Wow :/ Okay I'll get it checked.
I did it so recently so I’m surprised i can’t remember the question but it was pretty easy/straight forward. At worst I’d say leetcode medium but definitely on the easier/more straight forward side of medium.  If I remember the exact question I’ll let you know. 
That's the other thing lol...I definitely would've been able to finish the first question if we could code in Python. I coded in Java which I'm comfortable in as well, but I just find Python so much easier. Like I had a hard time getting the online compiler to recognize Hashmaps and Sets...for some reason import [java.io](https://java.io)\* wasn't working or something
I'm not sure what it means to be leetcode tagged, but yeah i think i got the same test as your friend as the first had to do with hashmap and the second had to do with graphs. Lol I'm not sure if I would call the questions straightforward though...I'm sure your friend must be super smart. The first one i think i definitely would've gotten if we could code in python, but in java it is a bit harder and i was having trouble using hashmaps and with importing java.util. The second one I definitely would not say you can solve if you know a "little bit of graph traversals" on my standards...that's a very hard question like even now I don't know really how to answer it
Shopify :)

Just relieved I got something this summer
[deleted]
Ah ok thanks! If you don't mind me asking, how do you get the emails of the recruiters of all those companies?
Honestly I've probably emailed 20 recruiters and I haven't had a single reply. 
Would you like swapping some recruiter emails? I will be looking for summer internships next year, and would like to prepare early.
I passed all test cases on 3/4, didn't have time to finish the last one because I was stuck on some stupid edge cases in previous problem that took like 20 minutes, but I wrote down detailed comments on what I would have done.
Did they reply?
Oh ok. Were you still able to schedule your on site?
Dropbox asks questions about OS? Like what?
Nope not sent to everyone :( Applied almost two months ago
Did you do it yet? I did it 100% and got rejected days after
Okay so I applied 9/4/2018, and heard back yesterday. During the application you could've applied simultaneously to 3 branches. I chose NY, LA, and Chicago I think. I don't remember. I think you can still re-apply too because they hire in waves I think. Doesn't hurt to re-apply! And thanks dude!
No haven't heard back either. I also passed all the test cases
Did you apply to US amazon sde intern as well? Have u heard from that
same here done it 2 weeks back and no reply yet
was it a telephonic interview for you ? do they ask behavioral ques as well ?
Thanks for sharing. heard the problems last year were dp but did we get the same this year?
Thanks! In hindsight, I should’ve seen that, it was pretty obvious 
This is a really dumb question, but say they ask a tree question or something like that, does c++ stl have that? I tried searching it up and it seems as thought you need to import some other things. 
Did anyone get the actual date yet? I'm a little worried because its next week (earliest monday), and I'm not sure if they'll send stuff out on the weekends
Same with me, havent got the confirmation email. Gave my availability in the first email 2 days back
Will do.
Thanks for answering my question. Congrats on the offer!
not sure if you're talking about the same thing, but if it's an online behavioral then you're gonna be talking into a mic and camera
Yeah as long as you aren't showing any notable red flags you should be good
Hey, I have PM you. Let me know if I can help you in any way.
MS student. Maybe it is different for BS positions?
what are they asking this sample? are they tagged googled on lc?
Yesterday, they responded to me and they sent OA2, thank you very much for your interest.
Good man

&#x200B;
I believe its the former, you can submit it anytime during the 7 days whether you close it or not
How was your third google interview. They gave me a third google interview as well
Nice, so did you apply through your university's coop board or do you just find the internships yourself and get the coop-credit. Did you do Google EP before or just a normal internship?
ah ok sorry for the confusion. Ok yeah it seems that they don't have heavy technical questions. Thanks
How soon did you get an onsite interview after your phone interview?
Can you tell me when was your final interview and after how many days did you get your offer letter?
Rip but yeah that's insane turn around
Thanks for the insight! Really helpful
Hey one more question! For AO2 and the technical interview, do you know if we can use built in functions such as STL for c++ or would we have to implement everything from scratch?
Like exactly. That’s sacrificing everything else. Not worth it to me. But to each their own. 
Ohh ok. Congratulations on your offer! Do you know when you applied, did you get an OA1 invite right away or you got an email that mentioned that you have passed the resume process onto OA1 and then got the OA1 invite within a time frame. And last question, did they mention how long from the OA1 invite that you have to complete it, like within a week or something?
Ah I see
Any chance there is an Android version of this?
How about yea
Nice! Why did you choose not to move forward with the process btw?
Do you mind if I ask about advice for the phone interview? I'm scheduling mine now, and I'm wondering what I should review. What kind of questions did they ask? Focused more on resume and experience? Or brain teasers? Or systems side knowledge? Multithreading?
Ya, that was a difficult one.

&#x200B;

I got lucky on that one because I had done a nearly identical problem on ([https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-malware-spread/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-malware-spread/)) about two weeks back in prep for my google interviews.

&#x200B;

Even though I had studied the solutions it took me the full time to complete -- one of my test cases was throwing a runtime error, and it turned out I had initialized a vector with the wrong size.
Hopefully I get lucky as well, thanks for the info.
Pros:  smaller and thus tighter knit intern community, BFFs (basically fb will give you 25 per person to do fun things with coworkers), all intern housing is in the city which is super pretty and has more to keep you entertained than MPK, good hiking.

Cons: seattle fall weather lol I went there to interview a few days ago and it was not pleasant.

Oh also, I was thinking of pushing back FB to fall also, will Google extend your return offer deadline until after you are done interning at FB?
Will let u know when I interview 
Were you applying for summer internship positions ?  What kind of coding question was it? Leetcode easy/Med/hard ? 
That's awesome man!! What field I'd your research in. I'm quite interested in research myself. So did you work at that research group during the summer after your freshman year or during the year? 
That's supposed to be confidential right?
Two weeks
Rejection came 1 week after for me, via e-mail to schedule a phone call.

Same to you!! Thanks for replying and hopefully I can give you useful info too:)))
No I am not lol. I also spoke to the manager of the SoC team for my third interview but I can only do Summer. It's been over two weeks and I haven't gotten a decision. So yeah, probably not happening. Enjoy the experience at Apple tho!
Only thing I can think of if you ask if there's been any update, depending when you last heard from them
I heard back later the same day (about 9 hours later.) Then had my virtual interview 2 days after that, and an offer the next day
Same haha but honestly I didn’t really wanna work for them lol so I don’t feel too bad :| kinda odd tho bc I thought a phone screen w HR would be hard to F up??
Hiring committee 
I got it in an email asking for times I was available to interview; interview itself got scheduled a week later.
>In my first round i solved one question then he asked me followup question which after some brain storming i gave the solution and finished coding right in time. In my 2nd round , i solved my first question , there were few followups which i solved . Again for the 2nd question i had to do some brainstorming and finished coding right on time. I am not sure, should i be confident about moving to HM ?

&#x200B;
Now that you mention it, it might not be for bnet but I'm not sure. Could be for any of the 5 I applied for. I only finished one of the challenges and only the first 3 test cases sadly but I commented what I would've changed to make it work for the others. I had logic correct for another but it didn't run. Others I had some code with some pseudo code explaining my thoughts. I really tried to comment a whole bunch so that they could see my thinking process.
I didn’t pass OA1 so I didn’t get an invite to do OA2
Had the interview 2 days back. It was pretty easy, brush up on arrays and hashmaps. Got the offer today
Thank you very much for taking the time to answer.

I think my process is a little different, I have scheduled two back to back chime interviews, I expect them to be technical since in the email they send me it said they would ask me to do a couple of coding exercises.
Being able to use basic data structures is probably helpful for the Hirevue problems, but nothing that specifically and directly quizzes you on DS&A.
solid, man. gl with your interviews!
yep, in ATL. I'm a first year so I feel really thankful they gave me the opportunity so i accepted it right away.
Hi! It was pretty standard. I had 2 technical interviews, followed by a round with HR and a hiring manager interview. I just got the offer today.

The technical interviews were both had 2 questions about a medium difficulty, and be sure to discuss a personal project in depth. Sorry I don't have a lot of advice, it was really normal so my best advice is to not work about it. Good luck! 
and are you also prepping for google?
Of course, good luck! :)
I thought they give 2 questions (1 each interview). Hmm are you a sophomore or freshman?
Do you know when they start sending out Online Assessments and when they stop recruiting?
Meh, didn't work out. Got a rejection :( I wonder why though, some people can only solve one question and they get an interview, yet I solved both and still nothing. Maybe because I'm not in the US, huh?
Yeah. I just got the email today. I though I need to wait after the deadline for OA1
I got my interview email 19 days after completing OA2. My interview went really well. My interviewer went to my school so we talked about that. She gave me a LeetCode easy problem and was surprised at how fast I solved it. She said that wasn’t a bad thing though. Afterwards she gave me the scripted Leadership Principles question’s and then I got to ask her about Amazon. I feel really good coming out of it, just gotta wait to hear back now.
Hi [visaj\_kapadia](https://www.reddit.com/user/visaj_kapadia), did you mail recruiter asking about status?
rip dude hope it works out either with this internship or any other!
Happy Cake Day modelpress! Stay positive and happy. Work hard and don't give up hope. Be open to criticism and keep learning. Surround yourself with happy, warm and genuine people.
Ah I see. Well thanks :)
Nah I think they’ll email you, at least when I got rejected from FBU they did 
No one mentioned anything like that at the time. I don't know anyone personally who has received anything about continued interest
no response LUL
Maybe today's the day
Mine was actually easier. And yeah, it sucks but you can't do much about it.
I would say it went fine overall. My first interview I solved the question they gave me and then there was a follow up which we just discussed over my approach and stuff.

For the second interview the question was trickier and it took me a bit of time and some hints but I got it and coded up the solution.

Only thing is I heard some people get asked two questions per interview so I'm not sure if that's what's expected 

What about you?
Yes
[deleted]
me neither :(((
the second one has all the video answers and stuff
Hmmm I can see that but then why give people all that time? I mean someone could go slower on the problems just because they see how much time they’re given. 
On-site 2 45min rounds
Took hirevue mid september, heard back mid november
second one: trees and arrays

phone: arrays

Thanks!
O shit my bad totally misread your username lol
That sounds like great advice, thanks for sharing! It's amazing to see how much of an effect a single internship can have on your perceived value, going from 3/100 on responses to far beyond.
Tower of god babyyyy, Maschenny sznn ⚡️⚡️⚡️
I trade with friends and use rocketreach too 
GL!!
Thanks 🙏🏼 
Ohh I get, Java is difficult in coding scenarios, I personally use c++ which has stl for sets and all and is amazing to use
Did you hear back? I had same issue with hashmap not being recognized.
Just Curious , why are you choosing shopify over amazon ?
I mean Shopify and Amazon are some pretty good choices.
Hey if you don't mind me asking, what was shopify offer? 
What position was your shopify offer for?
Yeah I did they didn't care. Sigh
PM me

Nope, what about you?
They haven't gotten back to me yet. I'm probably going to take an offer somewhere else.
I did it and got rejected too. 
Yeah, didn't end up going through :/
Whenever given a tree problem, in most cases you're given the root of the tree as a TreeNode object, which is defined in the problem. The only things I know of in the stl having to do with trees are the set, map and priority\_queue.
I got my actual interview confirmation two days ago (the 29th).
I didn’t even know it was possible to do an online behavioral interview, I feel like I would be really awkward and not know what to do or say. Good thing I’ve avoided them so far.
How are you still interviewing even after getting tons of interviews from top companies months ago?

Did you fail them all?
Exactly the same format and difficulty ad the first two
I found the job on my own. I applied for a normal Google internship when I was a sophomore since you're unlikely to get into EP unless you're an underrepresented minority, and I got it.
Hmm, about two weeks.
I won't tell you the exact date but about 2 weeks after my final interview I was moved to the "Project Matching Phase". It took me a few weeks to then get matched to a project. One week after that I had my offer letter.
I did both with Java. For OA2, I had to import what I wanted to use. For example, I wanted to use HashSet, so I had to import it. For my virtual interview, the environment couldn’t compile code, so imports didn’t matter. They were more interested if I knew how to solve the problem. I didn’t have to implement anything from scratch 
You can use still, I used a set, just include the corresponding libraries
I applied back in november and they didn’t email me until early february. They told me about OA1 in that email but sent the invite in a different one that came a little later that day.  I had a week to complete it yes 
I had already gotten other offers I really liked, and I was pretty tired from interviewing. But I really liked their process and I think their internship program is strong.
Algorithms, data structures, systems side knowledge. Wouldn't be surprised if they asked about multithreading, either.
[deleted]
yeah i saw that on leetcode but it just came out like a month ago? i did the Dropbox hackerrank back in September lolol. honestly every Dropbox interview was harder than the last
Yes I applied for the internship position (SDE Intern). It was an easy and a medium
[deleted]
I can message my hiring manager to check your files. You can PM me if you want
Yikes it's been 3 weeks for me now. 1.5 weeks since I sent a follow-up
last wednesday. i'll shoot him a message tomorrow i guess
Oh wow, hopefully I hear something before the holidays. Thank you. 
How did the virtual interview go if you don’t mind me asking? Like I’m assuming it was still pretty technical? 
Yeah I think it’s possible that they only had so many time slots for onsites and so they had to reject some people regardless
[deleted]
Congratulations!
I hope I do as well as you, did you got behavioral questions?
Yeah i got an email like that but it ended up being different. I was prepared for the tech interview and one turned out to be personal 
Let me know how it goes!
[deleted]
Have fun there! It’ll be great to have some experience going into your second year :) it’s nice that you’re proactive about it 
Aye congrats on the offer!! I already had my technical interviews on campus so I was just wondering how the HR and Hiring Manager round were like and it seems like it wasn't that bad based on what ur saying so thanks!
Facebook. I haven't heard back from Google yet but fingers crossed. I'll send you a friend invite link.
No, I am a sophomore. The prep slides my recruiter sent me said 1-3 questions per interview! I got a 2nd question in my 2nd interview because I solved the first one and all my interviewer's extra constraints pretty quickly
hey, i have OA1 exam in week. 

Do you mind sharing question patterns?
I did, but no response.
Okay thanks lmk if you get to know anything
got result?
Is it pretty late if i get into the pool on December?
For me in my first interview, he asked one question which i solved quickly , then he asked a follow up question . After a lot of brainstorming, i gave solution and finally coded just on time. In 2nd interview , i solved both questions but for 2nd question , whenever i was stuck he said you are moving in the right direction and again finally coded the solution just on time. It has been a week, i hope i get past the HC .
I only did the first then 😁😅
Probably so you can be calm and do your best. But if I give you an hour to reverse a linked list and you take 40 minutes, I'll for sure go with the guy who took 5 minutes.
was it hard? 
Okay cool. Thanks
Thanks. How soon after did you hear back from them for the interview after the assessments? 
Both of mine were tree/graph traversal and it seems like a very common topic in google interviews, so I'd say just be very familiar with them if you're looking for interview prep.

They were also both structured in a way that after you finished the "solution", they add more and more parameters & ask you how you'd deal with edge cases. So be open & have your og code be solid in case they ask you to expand upon it more. 

Good luck with your interviews!
No worries haha
wb the first part? khun?
Thanks
Omg, I just took that assessment. I did well on the first one I believe, but literally could not even get the second one to work. I did what you did and explained my logic through pseudo code, I was getting a weird error I could not fix. I thought it was hard. Hopefully they account for GPA, prior work experience not just the two questions. Did you hear back yet?
Amazon is no doubt a great place for an internship, especially for its brand 
value on your resumé. 

I heard experiences from both sides.

I chose Shopify because:  

- Perks. Amazon's ["frugality" principle](https://www.businessinsider.com/a-peek-at-amazons-culture-of-frugality-2014-4) isn't appealing to me. Hearing from past interns – no free food/drinks, beside coffee you make yourself. [You might not even get a MacBook as your daily driver.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/3ce0s8/dear_amazon_interns_some_advice_from_an_old_man/) (if you mind that). Work-life balance is non-existent. Fortunately, they don't cheap out on your salary!  
  
- Shopify, on the other hand, offers fully catered lunch every day. Every week, you can take 2 hours off in the morning to do laundry, house cleaning, etc.   
- I received the exact position I wanted @ Shopify (Backend Security) – didn't want to risk being placed in a 'meh' team at Amazon.   

Shopify can't compare to Amazon's global brand name and future intern opportunities it'll provide, but it is somewhere I can see myself working at full-time.
Backend developer intern in Ottawa :D

Debated between Toronto – but heard great things about the Ottawa office on top of the lower CoL.

&#x200B;
Nope
Ah that's too bad, sorry! Good luck!
yea same. what's the application status of your SDE Intern for Canada. Mine says "Application Submitted"
yeah it definitely was. I think betterment also did the interview behavioral interviews
No I got Linkedin.Still interviewing for Airbnb and Atlassian and Waiting for Google in the Fall
Also, you said you got one easy and one med-hard. Thus in terms of difficulty, was your third question like the first one or the second question .
Cool, did you have any previous internship experience when you first applied to Google or was it just your personal projects?
Do you think the Google internship when you were a sophomore was a game changer in terms of your opportunities down the line?
Thanks!
Grats on getting the virtual interview btw. Was that like an hour interview with ~10 behavior and ~50 for the 1 coding problem? Or how was that setting and process like if you don’t mind? 
Hmmm, I have a lot to study! Thanks for the help!
Dropbox asks you to return both the machine & the number of machines its removal prevents infecting.

Leetcode just asks which machine minimizes the difference.

You likely can use the same/similar  solution for both.
Oh wow, must've been posted after someone saw it in Drop Box's hackerrank.  Maybe it's a good strategy to wait a few weeks after apps open then.
That's awesome. What advice would you give a freshman interested in research? (If you don't mind me asking) I got a couple of ML research interviews lined up for the summer, I hope they work out. 
I would give it a bit longer. Consider that Thursday they would've been off, with some likely taking Friday off. Just my opinion, maybe end of the week if you aren't in a huge rush but someone might have a reason against it
You ever hear anything back? I had my OA2 around the same time and haven't heard anything. Hoping it's just the holiday season
It was technical. I was asked simple questions (leetcode easy) and then got the offer. There were no behavioral questions which surprised me
Yeah good point..... I’ve also heard that they want people who are crazy abt their product??? So maybe they wanted more enthu lol
About two weeks after I finished the initial coding sample.
Nope
Could you give me some examples of questions you got on the personal interview please?
I will if I remember, I still have a week and a half to prepare.
I went throw the interview last Thursday, I don't think I did too well but I'm waiting for a response before I lose hope. 

Your info was really helpful still, that's why I still have a little bit of hope
Yes, it said that they will be 45 minutes each.
I think they really vary, the hiring manager didn’t ask me any technical questions and we kind of just talked about my interest in Bloomberg and low-level programming, and about my school, and then he demo’ed the terminal lol I think I got lucky
Wow congratz! Have you taken data structures and algorithms?
Did you follow up after the interview thanking the interviewer for his time? If so, how did you get his details?
Will do
yeah jesus finally got the good news
I'm not a recruiter, I wouldn't know. 
Nah
roughly a day
Yeah Khun is her last her name, it’s korean 
Did you hear back? I had same issue with hashmap not being recognized.
When I interned at Amazon Toronto, our floor manager/director person decided that we would get free snacks like chips and stuff, and my team had a drink fridge, so we'd get people from other floors coming around all the time lol. Good times, goood times.
All the best man! I'm happy that you are pursuing what you want in your life than running behind brand name and prestige! You will surely reach great heights 👍
The Ottawa office is really dope. Congratulations!
Yup, mine says the same. I haven't heard Amazon Canada getting back to anyone yet. Probably January?
You must be one impressive mothafucka mad props.

Yes I’m jelly.
The first interview included 1 easy and 1 medium question. The second interview was also a medium, since I recognized the problem, but I didn't get a solution in time. Third interview was one easy and one medium.
Just a webdev internship at a tiny local startup, plus my good grades and a personal project.
Not necessarily. I also got an offer from Bloomberg in my sophomore year at the same time. Since the time periods didn't overlap, I accepted both offers.

However, the Google name isn't useless at all. It definitely helped me get a Microsoft offer, but I have plenty of other stuff on my resume too (hope that doesn't sound like I'm bragging!)
Thanks! Mine was scheduled to be 45 minutes. I had 2 LC easy problems, a design problem, and no behavioral questions. My interview lasted an hour and I got an offer the next day. Feel free to DM for more info
hm yeah maybe, but i feel like some smaller companies start getting way too full with onsites. like stripe isn’t interviewing till January now - so I still feel like it’s better to apply asap
Just my two cents: If you want to join a research group, definitely reach out to a few of your school's professors in your field of interest. There's a decent chance one will be willing to take free labor (you might even get paid if you're qualified and they have nice grants). If you're doing ML, make sure you have the foundational math background necessary (strong understanding of statistics, probability, linear alg, multivar calc). Having the math background makes learning/understanding ML SO much easier. Once you've learned the basics of ML, then start reading papers in your area of interest. Learning definitely takes time, and I'm often reminded about how little I know, but spending just 1 hr each day on the subject goes a long way. Anyway, good luck on your interviews! 
I'm not really in a rush I just hate the stress of waiting haha. But yeah I'll give it to the end of the week.
What I did to prep was go through each of the principles are understand their meaning. For each principle right out an example of how you can relate to that or an experience you had that you demonstrated one. They will ask you about times where you went above and beyond or had a hard task. The standard tech personal questions. There are a lot of guides online that can help you study.
[deleted]
Gotcha that doesn't sound too bad at all so thanks for letting me know! And yea their terminal is super dope 
Approx how long did it take for you to hear back about the offer after the onsite?
Nope! However my 2nd intro CS course covered all the basics, searching/sorting, trees, stacks/queues, etc. You will definitely be fine!
I did not email my interviewer (although I knew his name, searched it on linkedIn) . I sent an email to the recruiting coordinator.
R u moving to the Host Matching?
ok til thx
I did not pass man, but hope you pass
What does ur US SDE intern status say? mine says "No longer under consideration". I got a rejection email saying reapply in six months... man im just worried that by rejecting the US position that they've stopped considering our canadian application
Have you heard back from them yet detectivelemon. 
Oh god on my google interview I didn't even get to a second problem on my first interview, only finished the problem with a lot of help, but I got through both problems on the second one (although my method to get there on the second one was really hacky)
Nah it doesn't. I asked for it. When you say other stuff, do you mean other internships or projects/research?
Thank you so much
Thank you, that's really helpful.
4 days according to my email.
I think like 3 days
Yeah, but I'm hoping to get it pushed to fall b/c I want to try a different company for summer perhaps
Damn :(

How long did it take for you to hear back? 
Nope
I had one other internship at a small local startup, a great GPA, and a couple small projects.
Gotcha thanks!
Completed Saturday early early morning, heard back Tuesday..
