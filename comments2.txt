Twitter’s 2019 application opened yesterday!

https://careers.twitter.com/en/university.html
This is amazing! Thank you for starting this @mods
This thread is going to get pretty big as people keep posting more. Would people be interested in a Google Sheet instead? OP could link it in his/her posting, and people could add to that instead of commenting. I think it'd make things a lot simpler. 

Edit: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XnjJMX2PGLbwhnCDSCrSejOsUddv9mr9hBt3h5D6_kk/edit?usp=sharing) it is! I think I got most of the internships already posted. Feel free to add to it. And /u/xorflame if you could link this in your post, that'd be great.
Jane Street, Morgan Stanley, Citadel, and Capital One internship applications are open!
Is there going to be a similar list put together for New Grad Summer 2019 roles by chance?
Would be great if we can track companies offering Product/Program Management (PM) internships too!! 
Just got my first offer for the summer!

&#x200B;

[Here](https://imgur.com/aEMsCNh) is a list of all the companies I applied to. Good luck everyone!

I think international applicants are in a very different boat because of the work permit issues. I've applied to at least 40 companies so far and so have my friends with rather impressive resumes. But very few companies actually bothered getting back to us.

Just learned from a recruiter that Blizzard will have their applications open in October.

Has anyone heard back from JP Morgan after the hirevue? How long did it take?

Edit: Also, did anyone else think the questions were a bit too easy? I don't really know how they're gonna filter candidates with that.
Is there a list for Canadian summer internships? Specifically in Montreal or Toronto? Would appreciate it if there was one. 
Has anyone heard back from Visa? I got a notification that someone from Visa looked at my profile after the Hackerrank a week back but have not heard anything back since.
Did anyone get an email from Twitch saying

Did anyone get rejected from Goldman Sachs a while back for NOT being a junior? I got an email saying there was a mistake with scoring it, and that I’ve been given a chance to try taking  he hackerrank again.

Does anyone know any recruiter or email that I could contact them at?
Goldman Sachs says "Current status is Interview Completed. Thank you for completing your first round interview facilitated by HackerRank. We will be in touch soon with an update.". Before that, it was "HackerRank Completed". Does this mean I am not moving on? (By the way, I have not received HireVue)

Just confirmed my two google phone interviews next week for Summer 2019 Internship. I'm quite anxious. Two interviews? I thought it was just one! *take deep breaths*
Prob over concerned but I applied to a bunch of internships and its been ~2 weeks. Is it normal not to hear back yet?        
      
Also I submitted the Google EP the week it came out, but I haven't heard anything. Is it a lost cause?         
Does anyone know when most of the Summer 2019 applications close? Or are they all rolling admissions? I recently switched to CS (rising sophomore) and feel like I need some more time to prepare for DS&A and some projects...

Has anyone heard back from Microsoft Explore internship?
Anyone heard from Amazon? I haven't seen anyone mention them here yet. 
Applied to Amazon's SDE internship position and received an Assessment on Thursday. The Assessment was two part:

Part 1 consisted of a part A and a part B, and the only languages you can do them in are: Java, C, and C++. No Python, unfortunately.

&#x200B;

Part A was the usual 7 debugging questions that you have about 20 minutes to do. I teach part time so these were really not so bad, mostly 1 line fixes. I would recommend spending a good amount of time understanding what the program should do before you start changing things since Compiling actually takes quite a bit (like 8 seconds) which is probably intentional to make it harder. Don't worry if you get a bad score since I heard that people who got 4/7 and 5/7 have still been given final interviews.

&#x200B;

Part B was 24 logical questions that you are to complete in 30 minutes. These also aren't that bad, but the one catch is you **cannot go back to previous questions**. So you should really try your best to do the question on your first go, and if it's taking too much time just guess (it's multiple choice) and move on. 

&#x200B;

Part 2 was a coding challenge consisting of 2 questions (I'm not going to say what the questions are about, but I will say that if you know your data structures and algorithms that's great, but **make sure you know how to code them**). 

&#x200B;

My question for you all is this: I got 7/7 on the Debugging portion (it tells you your score), probably -3 or -4 on the Logical questions (they don't tell you your score so I'm estimating), and I got the first question fully correct on Part 2, but my second question didn't compile. I knew exactly which algorithm to use and so I designed helper methods to modularize my work, but the helper methods would not compile (all my brackets were correct and on [repl.it](https://repl.it) it compiled fine). So I guess you can't use helper methods and I wasted almost all my time on those methods that wouldn't work so I was donezo.

&#x200B;

From people who've done the Amazon SDE challenge in the past and have gotten to the final round of interview; do you think my score results are good enough to move on?

For coding challenges does it matter how long we take to finish it? Just finished one with only 5 mins remaining on the clock.
Reddit has internships up, no new grad positions though :-(

 

[https://www.redditinc.com/careers](https://www.redditinc.com/careers)
To those of you that have gotten responses, what companies and how long after you applied did you get them?

The only companies I got that I don't think were automated responses are Flatiron Health after 6 days and Visa after 6 days. Visa might be automated though. I also got contacted by Google after Foobar 3 days after I finished level 3, but the guy ghosted me after I sent him my resume. Pretty rough :/

I am a CC student and I'm planning on transferring to a 4 year starting fall 2019. Any idea if I need to/how to list that on my resume? I don't want to miss consideration for summer 2019 internships because it only says "AS in CS" on my resume.

I can't even apply for the 4 year until October at the earliest, and probably won't hear back until February. I don't expect any issue in getting accepted(applying to CUNY from SUNY CC, I'm sure one of my 3 choices will take me).

edit: well, people took the time to downvote me, but not respond to help me at all. That sucks :(

What year in uni should I be in to apply? I’m an incoming freshman and interested but my skills are quite lacking for such an internship 
Has anyone done the questions on hackerrank? How were they like?
The first column shouldn’t be sorted alphabetically, it should be based on when they open. This way when people look at this again they can start at where they left off. This is really useful!
I think it would be great if anyone who finds a new internship posting puts it in both the comments and the Google doc because if anyone has a question about any of the postings they could just reply to the comment about it, or if they just want to mass apply then they could go through the Google doc.
Interested 
Agreed, this is much easier.
The Capital One summit is not their internship right? The description looks the same as their TDP internship. 
Just curious, these are the internships that are notoriously more difficult than other ones right?
Did Capital One open already? I can't seem to find it.
This thread on /r/cscareerquestions has some info: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/95ff7y/undergrad_apm_or_become_a_dev_first (see comments for a few more companies, main one discussed is Google APM) I would post them here but I don't know much about these programs and don't want to post misleading info. 
Why is this down voted? I think it'll be a good addition
I'm with u/DriestScalp, no idea why this was downvoted. CS can lead to PM careers too people. Even if it's just in this thread, I think it would make a lot of sense to have that info here for anyone interested as well.
Congrats! Curious, since I've applied to a lot of the same companies, about how many have you heard anything back from (even just a hackerrank) after applying? Of your list, I've gotten some form of acknowledgment from maybe a quarter, moved to next round with a few, and so far have an on-site with one.
Nice! I've applied to a lot of theses too! Nothing yet lol 

So far only 32 applications though, going to push out so many more!
Awesome!!  Any way you could PM me the company name?
Google's application confirmation email starts off sounding like a rejection lol
How did you find that? I went to https://careers.google.com/students/, and clicked See Internships under "Internships in Engineering & Technology", and I don't see it.
Does anyone know if there will be a separate application for their MI location? It’s not listed in this job posting.
I totally agree with you and I am experiencing the same problem. But I don't think we can blame the companies for that; there already too many competitive applicants in the US, why should they bother with internationals except the ones that are exceptionally good
Literally go big4 or go home situation for us. 
I feel you. Every time I have to answer the work authorization question I get the feeling that it's surefire way of my application going to the trash pile. Doesn't help that it's not the best
Got a hackerank test from them. Anyone know how long the invite is valid for? I want to brush up on my hankerrank before doing it. Also, how hard are they usually?
Do you know much about their application process? I've always heard that internships in game dev are always ridiculously competitive
Sounds about right ,they had them open during that time last year 
I have a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/christine-hu/summer-2019-internships/blob/master/README.md) that I'm trying to keep updated! I posted it earlier in this thread, but deleted it bc i wasn't sure if it was appropriate to post here. i do think it'll be helpful for peeps so yolo
I made it with a throwaway Google account which I've forgotten the password to, and it looks like someone changed it so you need permission to edit it. :/
Apple says "between Fall 2018 and Summer 2019", I'm assuming this is for the Winter? They took down a lot of earlier applications (Back-End, Core OS) that had the same timeframe. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
Damn, I got rejected from Honey the day after I applied. I thought my resume was pretty strong too (I have two previous dev internships). What else are they looking for? 
Is this for Honeywell?
Yes, that happened to me two days ago. But yesterday I got another email asking me to schedule an interview, and this time it was legit, so you're still in the running.
We don't talk about those
I applied here and got a Hackerrank invite.  There were 2 questions.  My first question involved API's and URLs which I've never worked with before.  I'll get those experiences this Fall in classes.  I just closed the tab lol. 
Same questions on my HackerRank.

API and URLs. I think I could maybe do it, but not without looking everything up as I go, so I just shut it down.

If anyone is going to do it, just a tip if the interface confused you, you can add imports at the top of the editable window.
Pro tip: Don't apply for their trading internships unless you're literally a human calculator
Just got a hackerrank invite from here, anyone taken it yet and know if it's leetcode hard medium or easy?
    Previous internship experience with IBM
    Bachelors or Masters Degree

Lol wat?

I've had multiple recruiters tell me that no one reads cover letters. Don't worry
I've moved on without them. I think they're a bigger deal at smaller companies because you cost them more resources and they really only want you if you're into the product and considering full time.
I just upload my resume for the cover letter section if it's required. My resume can speak for itself, and if they want more info they can contact me directly.
Has anyone else got this error when applying? 
"Uh oh. The job you are trying to apply to is no longer listed..."
Hey, I got the offer too -- congrats man!
[deleted]
Did they tell you your location before or after you accepted?
Nice! What position did you apply for? I can only see Business/Advise roles
I haven't heard back either and I finished the HireVue last weekend.  When did you complete it?

Wtf they asked DP just did it 
I think Shopify is in Canada
Vast majority of Canadian internships will open up for hiring in Janurary/ February, for the Summer
same
I got a rejection after a hackerrank, so I guess you have hope
They haven’t even sent me a hacker rank 
Yeah i did too. wtf is that all about
I got that too. I feel like its automated though.
Got it too!
Lol I can see how a conversation working at target goes.  
"So /u/monsterbasher where did you work last summer?"  
"I was an intern at Target"  
"Oh... I didn't realize Target needed interns"  
I have had coding challenges from:

- Twitter
- Stripe
- Two Sigma
- Akuna Capital
- Flatiron Health

I was rejected from Two Sigma after completing their coding challenge. I'm also in host matching with Google for Winter 2019.
Stripe, Facebook, Riot Games, and a couple of the HFT/Finance places have gotten back to me for Summer '19
Interviewed for Microsoft yesterday.
Two Sigma, Stripe, Palantir, Goldman Sachs. 

Completed HireVue for Goldman about 10 days ago, waiting to here back if I'll move to onsite. Rejected from the rest due to poor Hackerrank results (need more practice). 
Response wise Facebook, Pure Storage, Goldman Sachs, Verizon, and Asana have gotten back to me about second interviews/rejections for next summer.
Yeah. For GS it took right at almost 1 month to hear back about onsite after HireVue. 
F
Yea, scheduled interviews
Shopify
Microsoft Explore and Google EP are open to those studying in North America
Lol, this internship requires internship experience. 
Don't apply to Riot.

Do they accept non-gamers?
It has been known to not always be updated with current application statuses, so just keep that in mind :)
This is beautiful thank you!
Is anyone else struggling to submit their Microsoft application? There isn't any indication that it was successfully submitted and I don't get any active applications.

If anyone could help me out, I'd really appreciate it.
Is not the Facebook position for internship/co-op during 2018?  
It says in the qualifications: "Ability to obtain and maintain work authorization in the country of employment in 2018".
does anyone know anything about the Facebook University internship?

Got a hacker rank from GS, 4 days to complete it. Any advice? I have never done hacker rank before. 
you mean like [this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/91c8de/summer_2019_megathread_eu/)

which is useless, IMHO
Link: https://www.airbnb.com/careers/departments/position/1213896
wow this application portal sucks
Pretty easy, two coding questions. One was about making change, and the other was about palindromes. Then there were two video questions where one asks you to talk about how you came up with your solution, and the other was a general behavioral question IE tell me about a time in tech when.....
Me and two of my other friends got it recently. I am going to prepare for it more than I did for my google tech screening and will let yall know
The coding questions were really easy compared to other online coding challenges I've had. 
No, I've read around of it taking up to a month before an invitation to a super day (on-site) occurs. I'm in the same boat as well, "Interview Completed" and about 2 weeks since HireVue completion. 
How much time did they took to send you hirevue after hackerrank?
I took it 2 weeks ago, have you heard back since? 
[deleted]
Not yet
and I am here waiting for HireVue round. I passed all testcases in hackerrank on 4th sep.
I applied about 2 weeks back.Nothing yet. Hopefully something soon.
whend you apply?
I got that same email last week. I’m gonna wait a bit and email them for another hackerrank if anything just for more practice.
Nope, I completed the hirevue few weeks ago and haven't heard a peep since then
It was a project and you need to fix 5 bugs. Fucking love those types of challenges and not the usual bullshit other companies ask for. 
I'm planning to do it later tonight as well
I'm gonna do it later tonight if nobody responds ffs
I also got the same automated reply from them.
Just got the same reply. I am happy that I left their stupidly long (multiple) questions empty, since they did not even bother to write this location restriction in the application page.
Same goes with with my application status also.
I noticed the same thing.
I applied to Goldman Sachs a week ago. How much time does it take for them to invite you for the HackerRank test?
I'm the same but mine was after the hirevue.
There's also an opening for a Summer 2019 intern at Salesforce.org, which I think is a subsidiary of Salesforce.

https://salesforce.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/External_Career_Site/job/California---San-Francisco/Summer-2019-Intern--Software-Engineer---Salesforceorg_JR20754
Internship applications are normally rolling admissions.
Juniors only :(
I found it to be the most difficult HackerRank I've ever received. Finished the first question in \~15 minutes, spent the other hour and 45 minutes and couldn't get an optimized solution on the 2nd. Was rejected the next day.

This is for an internship btw (heard the new grad HackerRank is different).
It was difficult. The second one is difficult to optimize, and I couldn't pass one test case. I found the Palantir one much more difficult however.
When did you apply - just curious.
Most companies aren't like that. I feel like it's a good assumption that you will have 1 interview each academic year. After the year is over, it wouldn't be wise for companies to not interview you again. In fact, if you apply again it would show character and how badly you want an internship. Plus, you could learn a whole lot in a year so I think most companies know that.

I think you should apply ASAP because the process is always rolling, so it is in your best interest to apply early. Best of luck! 
FWIW I failed the phone screen last year and got it again this year
I haven't heard anything and I can't even login to my portal... The reset password form isn't working for me. Is this happening to anyone else?
I just heard back (rejected, as always).
Ayy me too!!  What location?
I interview onsite and got rejected. Place seemed like a nice place to work but it seemed like a cult to me. If you want to know the entire interview process pm me because I memorized everything lol
Nope, not yet
Yeah me what's up?
I did. Already completed the survey and some practices of the coding sample, will most likely be doing the coding sample this Saturday when I'm free.
Yeah I got it too! I'm not sure what to expect from the coding sample
Applied the day that they opened (Monday), took the survey and sample in the morning on Thursday, and got an email for an interview that night. I did have a referral however.

Survey was basic behavioral/workplace culture questions. The coding sample was 2 questions, pretty easy just basic data structures and loops.
Took them 24 hours to respond to me. Monday for you probably, since it's the weekend.
I did mine on Saturday but I haven't heard back. Have you?
When did you apply?  And when did you get the challenge?
been waiting a month. honestly wanted to work for them but ended up taking an offer elsewhere just today.
Yeah I did -- I took mines over almost two months ago and I heard back on Monday 
I just completed it. One easy, one easy/medium, one medium.
Just got a rejection email from JPM after attending their Code For Good event in delaware. I cannot be more upset rn after actually winning the whole damn thing. 
When you take urs? I took mine last Friday and no response yet! 
In some cases it can even be *three*, if you do well one one but not the other. I'm interviewing for Winter right now (but the process is probably the same for summer) and I was contacted to schedule a third phone interview due to mixed results on the first two.
That's great! When did you apply?
Good luck!  I think that the back-to-back interview will be a good thing because it kind of gives you two chances in a way.

Also, without sounding weird, me and you have heard back from almost the exact same companies.  Google, AirBNB, DRW, Vanguard (on-site), etc.  Maybe I'll see you at Google this summer!
Same, myn is on Monday. Goodluck
Did you get a second questionnaire to fill out as well? Like after your snapshot survey and your coding sample were done 
Congrats, just out of curiosity what were the questions on you snapshot coding challenge? :)
You'll get used to this
Nearly every company are rolling
Does anyone know if they offer relocation costs? I'm only willing to write cover letters if they offer relocation.
I think this is the new grad application.
lmao they want gpa of 3.5 + for a software engineer.
Neither of the Big N's do that but Garmin does hahaha
I don't see any SE or SD Intern Positions on EA's website right now. Am I missing something?
If anyone is having issues with the EA application being in Spanish - add *"&locale=EN"* to the end of the URL on the application
somebody post internship links please.
I'll be doing an on-site there (Charollote) somewhat soon, how was it?
What's their interview process look like? Do they do on sites for everyone or just those that live near an office? And do you know what they pay? 
For mine my interviewer asked me a couple of Software Engineering terms and explain them ie unit testing vs acceptance testing and the pros/cons of each. Then we did three code reviews in three different languages Java, C# and Python and I had to say what was bad about it, and what could have been done to improve memory/space complexity.
I had about 15 minutes to do a Leetcode easy problem.
Have you had your phone interview yet? How did it go if you did?
\[removed\]
I applied but did not hear anything. Did you prefer the delaware office? I doubt it matters, but I preferred a different location.
[deleted]
I did it last year in the same office but didn't get an internship out of it. They're evaluating you during the event and can recommend you for an interview. 
in my experience you generally don't hear back if you don't get it.
I got a reject after 2 days. No interview. No test.
Yes
I applied but didn't hear back. I think its still for 2018 only
Yeah, I did.
Wow, that's fast for an on-site. Did you have a phone interview first? I just got a request for a phone interview from them and am curious how the process works.
How long did it take to hear back from Stripe?
Graduate students only
Usually, they'll ask you behavioral questions and go over your resume with you. Towards the end, they will most likely ask you to solve a leetcode easy algorithm problem. This interview is meant to be a screening interview to make sure you are who you claim to be.
When did you apply approximately?
Really easy, but they autoreject *after the HackerRank* if you're a Sophomore.
I honestly don’t understand why everyone is saying it’s easy. I’ve done 15-20 hackeranks so far, and that was the only one I outright failed. I found it the most difficult by far.
Nope
Yep, a recruiter reached out and asked me to schedule a time for a casual conversation, and schedule a time for a technical assessment. Applied through a referral.
Im in it right now, and could only fully solve the first q. Im thinking about giving up lol.

Theres 4 ridculously hard questions, like really hard, never seen this kind of hard question in a hackerrank.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Atlassian
for those who heard back from squarespace, did you guys apply with a cover letter? or just your resumes
I've done it and have an initial phone interview scheduled. Didn't find it very hard.
Got it today, haven’t even opened the email. Is it hard? 
Lyft, Facebook, Dropbox, Pinterest, Etsy, HubSpot and Two Sigma
atlassian - negative. they do not sponsor visas(((
So far, Google, FB, Twitter, Etsy, Akuna Capital and Two Sigma.
Facebook, Google, Dropbox, Two Sigma, Stripe, Bloomberg, Microsoft, Affirm
I got into the hackathon and also received the hirevue which location did u apply to for the hackathon?
I'm in a similar boat. I got rejected for their hackathon since I went to one last year. JPM strictly have their hackathon for new folks. Though, I got their Hirevue  a day after I applied for their internship role. 
[deleted]
[deleted]
Wondering the same thing. I had my first round interview 3 weeks ago and haven't heard back.
I literally applied the day after the application for explore released. I'm from Canada btw. Still haven't gotten contacted by recruiters. Anyone else in same shoe?
In case someone that knows about the Google EP shows up.

- Is it only available for North America or can you apply as international (No need for visa sponsorship)?
There's definitely more URMs than not in the program but a fair amount of white/asian men still get interviews and the offer. So, definitely still apply but I have heard of guys who applied for EP and were rejected but got interviews for SWE so apply to both. Also, spend some time on the essays, especially the one about what makes you diverse since there's more to diversity than just race/gender and coming from a unique background will help you stand out for sure
[deleted]
[deleted]
[deleted]
big 4's do that (heard not Amazon this year) and some big N's. 
Yelp does
Rejected, but they forwarded me to the interview stage for their regular swe internship 
Do you guys know what to put in the Work Experience if I have never had any internships or work experience? It said required though.
Just got an email from them earlier today. A two part Debugging/Math challenge. Haven't started yet, but anyone have any tips? I heard that if you ace it you get an offer, but I'm not certain.
Got rejected a while back. I applied at the end of the August I guess.
Everyone I know who applied there hasn't heard back yet. 
did you end up moving on?
[deleted]
You're probably still in consideration.
Messaged a recruiter that send the Hackerrank and then they just send me general rejection email, eventhough I had all the bugs fixed, features implemented and even did some of the hidden ones. Their recruiting process seems like a big mess.
Late September
Got rejected last week by Airbnb, Bloomberg and IBM. Applied like 3-4 weeks ago. Waiting for others.
Got rejection mail from Lyft, Airbnb, bloomberg. Please list out the companies from which you heard back also.
Does Apple have summer internships? I thought they only opened the winter/spring ones.

Anyways from the companies you listed I have only heard back from AirBnB.
Airbnb and Asana
I heard back from Airbnb, Pinterest, Yelp, Dropbox, and Twitter
just got rejected from AirBnB today, haven't heard back from any of the others. I think linkedin closed their applications today, as well, so maybe they're full
Remind me tomorrow and I'll fix it. 
References will usually get you past the resume screening round and put you to the first round of interviews whether that be a hackerank challenge or phone call.
You're fine, it's just that they don't want you to intern after graduation
When did you get it / apply?
wondering same thing
Some companies don't allow for referrals after you applied on the online portal. Amazon is one that comes to mind. For others this doesn't matter.
It will probably mean that a normal referral through the company portal won't work. But if your referral emails a recruiter directly, it might help.
I received an email inviting me to Code For Good from JP. I submitted my hirevue roughly two weeks ago.

Does anyone know if this was an invite that was shotgunned to all applicants? Or is it an actual sign of progress?
Etsy's is interesting, not your typical algorithmic coding challenge. Instead, it's more applications focused. Airbnb this year has many different challenges - I got challenge 19 and didn't think it was too bad, especially compared to last year's. 
when is the due date for Etsy?, email says Oct 19th, i'm confused if it's Oct 19th or Sept.
Applicants must be authorised to work in the US :(
Juniors only too
Capital One already gave me an offer. I submitted my resume three weeks ago and then got invited onsite last week. Goldman Sachs wanted to invite me onsite, and I applied one month ago. Etsy, Stripe, Facebook, Airbnb sent me hackerrank challenges within a week.
[deleted]
I don’t think they give them to everyone, but I completed the challenge and passed all test cases but was still rejected so idk
Rejected without a coding challenge.
No I got rejected without a programming assignment
Yes after the time limit is reached the the test
Yes couple weeks ago, haven't heard back yet. There's coding and behavioral. I got a med DP problem and something unrelated to DS&A
they took my CV 2 weeks after hirevue.
by Hirevue do you mean the recorded video interview for Verizon?
I did the hirevue for Verizon connect and still haven't heard back. Why do you think the responses will be delayed until 2019? By then most folks would have already completed their job search
Both in the same location or different?
[deleted]
I have heard some people say so. But, last year no one reached out to me after filling it. Also this year, I filled it 11 days ago, and still no one has mailed me.
Did you get a snapshot too? I got a questionnaire and snapshot 
I took long to to look up the library.

I passed all tests. But I got rejected :)
Finished it pretty fast with 100% test cases and am now on onsite. I heard it was designed to be relatively easy, but they're looking for your code quality as well, which led to a few of my friends getting rejected even tho they 100%'d it.
Companies that don't usually say it on the internship description. Among the big ones, the only one I know that doesn't is J.P. Morgan.
They are asking too many questions. I applied but left some of them empty.
Me too!!  Are you by chance going to the Richmond, VA office on the 18th?  

I have a couple friends that interviewed with them last year, and they said that the case study questions were really important but at the on-site stage it's mainly about culture fit.

Best of luck!!
You happen to know if they take sophomores?
>Lending

Hi I got a coding interview from LendingHome.  Do you mind telling me a bit about just so I know what to expect?  Thanks man.
Learn JavaScript. Contribute to Open Source projects, put that in your resume. Tidy up your resume, apply within September and October and just constantly check throughout the year. Learn data structures and algorithms to actually pass the interviews.
hey! how's it going man. Don't worry, I had the same problem last year. Sophmores are harder to hire for companies I guess. My success has been a lot better this year now that I'm in 3rd year, so don't worry! I'm sure you'll have a better chance next year.

Try applying for MS Explore and Engineering Practicum at Google (one of the Canadian Google offices preferably). They hire exclusively first years and second years, so you might have a better chance there.
Many US companies do not sponsor us :(
One of my interviews was just chatting about stuff on my resume and the other three were purely technical.
That was quick man! when did you apply?
I have first round interview via Skype. They said it'll be "variety of behavioral, problem solving, and technical questions". What kind of technical questions should I expect?
hell yea
is your resume strong? didnt hear back from em? :(
When did you finish the Hacker Rank? I completed mine Aug 23 but haven’t heard back.
For everyone who is as lazy as me

I never put a cover letter and have been doing pretty good for now. No response from airbnb or slack yet.
no cover letter, received coding challenge from airbnb on 9/10. applied 8/23
Heard back from airbnb without a cover letter
Send an email to your recruiter, she should be able to help.
Twitter's process is weird. I'd do both just in case. 
You're good for Twitter University, however I believe you have to do another application for Twitter Academy.
Twitter easy. Akuna: hard 
I havent heard back from lendinghome either. Has anyone yet?
Not that difficult, but I had 'terminated due to timeout' in some cases. Lame.
when did you first hear back from them? Did they give you a coding challenge? I applied a month ago and still haven't heard anything. I'm guessing I was rejected.
Did you interview yet? I just got notified of receiving an interview and was quite surprised I got one tbh
My initial screening was on campus, but I heard others had phone screens.
how long did they reach out after you applied
Took Asana, it's not too algorithmically hard, I'd say an easier LC Medium.
Questions build off of each other. Not too bad. 
big problem divided in sub problems. Relatively easy but time is tight I would say.
when did yall apply
[deleted]
Just finished. Not bad. 
Hirevues are basically just a behavioral interview where they have recorded questions, they give you some time to think, then you record your answer. It seems to be common in various financial companies (as I got one from GS). 
[deleted]
What's fidelity internship application link?
All three of those have reached out for first rounds (hackerrank, etc)
I got hackerrank invite from stripe today, a month after applying in august.
Haven't heard anything back either rip
[deleted]
Well just took the IMC one 
When applying there was this question - "Include a link to an application (or two!) that you’ve built using Twilio. Bonus points for pointing out bugs or things that annoyed you/could be better about the platform." I got nothing to write for this and I'm worried that it might be a straight up rejection cause of that
It's easy.
How was the phone screen? 1 or 2 questions, dp?
Unfortunately, it's true. After the first two technical interviews, you're supposed to have a quick  15 min chat with your recruiter, followed by an interview with a senior manager. Unless, of course, you didn't pass the technical interviews.
Sadly they say that to everyone. They told me that the interviews would only be 2 hours but it was actually closer to 4 hour.
How was your onsite? Did they ask any Design or DP problems? Just want to know how to best prepare! TIA 
Would you know if the SE intern position in NY office starts in summer or in January? Or can they just change the timeline depeding on situations?
anywhere from 1 day to 2 weeks depending on the company

I think that’s the same posting for Summer 2019. I just emailed my recruiter from before though and said I was interested in interviewing and she set it up.
Mans just trying to get an interview.. :(
It’s been 3+ weeks for me lol
Is it first round or final round? I did my first round over the phone but it's probably similar
Wasn't too bad. Be prepared for general behavioral questions, wasn't too technical
They may never reply. I completed it a month ago and I haven't heard back yet.
I finished the Hackerrank in August last year and didn't hear back about next steps until December. Just about 4 months. Their process makes little sense. In fact, I don't even think the Hackerrank is weighed very heavily at all. 
Ghosted :(

I got invited to hubspot onsite at the end of october. I didn't know they were doing onsites before then. Mind if I pm you in  a week for what to expect on the onsite?

My university had a special summer program that helped students build a project from basic cs-backgrounds. Check ur schools resources
Yes, but they're aimed at minorities in CS.
[deleted]
Bloomberg and Palantir! DM me any questions you have
What does the status say in the application portal?
I completed my hirevue in August and still haven't heard back. I feel like I got lost in the shuffle. Did you get your status update through email or did you have to check your status portal?
I didn't even get the initial challenge, and I've had 3 webdev-focused internships, lol.
How did you get an invitation from them??

I really wanna go Slack but didnt get any email from them .. 
Still waiting

I didn't do code for good though, but I'm supposedly moving forward for the next round

I'm supposed to have two phone screens according to the recruiter/hr lady
I just got scheduled an on-campus
I got their challenge then a rejection after that. Challenge was hard and almost not very intuitive, but that’s my opinion. Still love them though 
I finished 3 two weeks ago and didnt get back any after that
I finished two and just got scheduled for the next steps 
Be glad! I haven't even got a response to my application yet...
This sub is NOT a good representation of all students applying to Google lol
Is this internship or full time? I applied for sde and never got a hackerrank (straight to phone interviews) 
yaa like a month ago. But didnt get back anything after that
[deleted]
Only for full time roles at Apple
I heard back from my interviews in one day saying that I had moved to the hiring committee stage and an offer two days after that. However, I did have an exploding offer that pushed the process along nicely. I would recommend emailing your recruiter again.
Have you heard back by now? 
Same situation, but did not make it through!  


however, my situation is definitely not reflective of yours! Hang in there, hope you hear good news!
You'll find out soon. What happened? 
Nope no reply from them.
Leetcode easy + medium
not for uber, idk about airbnb
i applied online for both and also got referred for both - heard back fast 
Not yet
Going to do my Akuna Capital and Peloton hackerranks tonight! I'll try and keep you posted how then went. I've heard the Akuna is Hard difficultly though.
Peloton's was quite hard I think
First? Man I'm on my 30th as a sophomore, just keep grinding!

&#x200B;
[deleted]
Get used to it tbh, it's nbd
Soph as well. I'm counting almost 30 apps as well. keep on going! 
[deleted]
1. You should be getting an email, if you didn't, they either just passed on the resume to the recruiter directly or lied to you about referring you just so you don't pester them further (better to confirm again with them)
Asana – a recruiter reached out after 1-2 weeks after referral.

LinkedIn – got a confirmation email about the referral, then a recruiter reached out 1-2 weeks later about scheduling a call.
I got one as well. Any tips would be appreciated!
Why is this comment being downvotes? What timeframe does this winter internship cover? Also does rejection from winter internship equal rejection from summer internship 
0 if you never apply...
I did the DRW challenge, and it was 3 problems. 1 easy (variation of stock price buy/sell), 1 medium (recursive checkers solver), 1 hard. I finished 2 of them and wrote down my thoughts for the third. Got denied a couple of days later.
Wait.. Airbnb has onsites now for interns?
How was the hackerrank?
How did your interview go?
still not yet :( but a lot of people haven't! seems like they sent one round of responses mid-december though
You're downvoted because this thread isn't for resumes. Make a post for itself, or ask in r/cscareerquestions when they do their bi-weekly critique threads
I would suggest starting a post with that information. I think people downvoted you because this is not the thread to ask that question.
Is this for summer 2019?
Looks like this is for new grads in 2019.
Is this for interns? Or full time software development engineers? I can’t tell from the description of the application.
You get like a week to do it once it’s opened, just take your time. My problems weren’t bad at all
Have you got any reply after hackerrank about next step?
The test I received was string/array heavy. All 3 challenges I got was medium/hard hackerrank challenges. If you can solve all the hard array challenges on hackerrank you should breeze through it.
as in 2 easy leetcode and 2 hard leetcode problems?
just apply, worst case you get a no. you get more experience in applying to jobs and throwing your name out there won't do harm
I got 3 questions, the first 2 were pretty easy (just some parsing and DS) the third is a tree problem, i started 2hours ago and right now i'm getting 9/10 right answers, one of the test cases is giving me Time limit exceeded :/
Nope, summit is a one week program. It was fun though, you should apply to both anyways
Jane street, Citadel, Akuna, DE Shaw, Two Sigma, Jump Trading are supposedly the hardest. Also probably half of these at least prefer/only accept c++.
Jane Street and Citadel are, yeah. 
Thanks friends!
Thanks!! I agree! 
Those are pretty good numbers. Off the top of my head:

* Palantir (recruiter reached out >> HackerRank >> phone interview >> rejected)
* Goldman Sachs (HackerRank)
* Barclays (some behavioral quiz >> HireVue w/ coding >> final round video interviews >> offer)
* JP Morgan (HireVue w/ coding)
* AllianceBernstein (phone interview)
* Hubspot (contacted recruiter from when I applied last year >> coding challenge)
* Stripe (HackerRank)
* Red Ventures (phone interview)
* DRW Trading (coding challenge)
* Virtu Financial (coding challenge)
* Two Sigma (HackerRank)
* illumio (take home coding challenge)
* Wolverine Trading (coding challenge >> phone interview)
* BookBub (take home coding challenge >> rejected)
* Facebook (recruiter reached out >> phone interview)
* Vanguard (HackerRank >> phone interview)

I'm sure there's some others that I'm missing. At this point I have a lot of pending coding challenges/interviews, but I'm pretty happy with the offer I have so I probably won't continue the process unless I think the offer will be substantially better. 

&#x200B;
It's Barclays (NYC).
I knew from a recruiter that they opened today, and found it via LinkedIn.
Yeah definitely. Its not the companies' fault. Yet its a shitty situation for us. So many companies that I would love to work for but I don't have the opportunity to because I was born in the "wrong" country.
sweet thanks. Yea keep it up
Dude me too, I have a pretty strong resume and took the L. Maybe cuz it's a startup they want a cover letter/demonstrated passion about the company?

You already got a reply for summer 2019? Wow!
It took me 20 min to find how to import the library in Java because the library imports were grayed out. After that I just closed the tab lol.
You didn’t have yo use any external APIs. It was a pretty simple one as far as they go
What does closing the tab do? Can they watch what you do in real time?
Can you elaborate. What kind of questions do they ask? I heard lots of multiplication and divison, but are the numbers like 82 * 88 or are they like 102 * 956?

Thanks man, if you would feel more comfortable, a PM would be great. I'm about to take the traders test, but I have no clue what to expect. Best of luck!
Mine consisted of one that I would consider easy, one medium, and one hard, though the hard was significantly more difficult that any other one I’ve done.
Just want to update. Solved 2/3 on the hackerrank with zero code written for the hard problem, maybe a few comments about my thought process but that was it. Made it to next round.
If you find out please tell me. I have mine postponed until I get back from vacation.
Is that a recursion?...
Yeah their preferred qualifications are a bit much
They put up a new posting to the correct url on linkedin
By now you've seen three parts: Behavioral, Technical and Case. For Technical, expect an OO Design question, and two Leetcode easy questions. 

The case interview was a bit tricky for me -- as long as you can work with your interviewer to get to the right solution (and not get frustrated) you'll be good. 

Behavioral is standard stuff -- mostly "tell me about a time when" questions.

Good luck!

Finished it on Monday this week, haven't hear back
IIRC from when I took it a few weeks ago, one of the questions kind of looks like a DP problem, but it's actually not and can be solved very simply in constant time.
Montreal has Google, Shopify, Expedia and AirBnb for all I know. Expedia pays very well and great work culture. Shopify wants you to complete a Developer challenge before applying and I fucking hate that 
I just hope I hear something in the coming week
[deleted]
I actually knew a couple kids from my school who interned at Dick’s Sporting Goods, a lot of these traditional stores are rapidly expanding to ecommerce so they actually got to work on pretty cool stuff from what I hear. I’m assuming Target’s similar, but it definitely sounds a little strange, like that one guy on /r/cscareerquestions who interned at McDonald’s lol
This was me when I found out Pornhub hired interns...
how long did it take for them to reach out to you after your phone interviews?
When did the apps for Google Winter 2019 open up? I'd like to apply for Winter 2020 and was wondering how much time I have to prepare.
Hey what timeframe does google winter internship happen? Before I apply I want to make sure it's fits in my with schedule
With Hackerranks or further?
When did you apply to Facebook?
Is this by applying online?
 How much time did they all took to send you hackerrank invite after applying online? 
When did you hear back from GS? I've finished their hirevue last week and I'm still waiting for a response.
have you applied to software engineer intern position in facebook or any other? 
When did you submit your applications?!
[deleted]
Is a Hirevue the next step after the Hackerrank for GS?


[deleted]
Wow fuck that.
Wow. While I'd expect they'd hire more interns who've completed other internships first, having it as a basic requirement is just ridiculous. Sounds a bit elitist honestly.
Not necessarily, I’m in the interview process right now as a rising sophomore and do not have any internship experience.
That freaking sucks but riot isn't gonna shut down any time soon and avoiding applying isn't going to change anything. I'd rather apply and be the change.
That's disappointing to know about them :( 
From reading glassdoor and reddit, it looks like you have to be into some game (even if it isnt theirs)
I was able to submit, and on my action center it said my app was completed. Do you have a confirmation email that you applied? 
Hey, the same issue is happening to me. I've tried to submit my application 3 times on multiple browsers but nothing seems to save. I've also tried submitting a ticket but that doesn't seem to go through either. I emailed my recruiter letting him know, but did you ever find a fix or did it just go away on it's own?

EDIT: Seemed to go away on its own. Weird.
I was able to submit.  Did anyone else get a "scheduling interview" update only to have Microsoft send out an email a day later saying it was unintentional and no official decisions have been made?
I'm pretty sure it comes out a lot later (as in December/January) based on what I remember from last year.
They weren't too sophisticated, but quite tedious.
What's so bad about it?
[deleted]
by making change you mean like dollar amounts right? 
Do they hire freshman? 
1 week
I don't think that's true. It says the same thing after the Hackerrank. 
oh really? that sucks. I thought that meant hirevue completed. Since before the hirevue my status said "Additional Interview required". Then a day after I completed the hirevue it said "Interview Completed"
When did you take the HireVue?
I also completed the HackerRank. How can I know if I passed all test cases?
Do it and report back :P 
If you ctrl f someone took it and said it was more applications oriented and not typical LC
I just got a different rejection for a different position at Github. And all the fields I entered were the exact same, wth
afaik hackerrank invite is automated in gs, got it 2 hours after applying.
I just checked it. It seems that I got the invitation the same day.
True but like...I wanna know how long I can put things off lol
Are there just two questions?
Damn that was harsh. I received the hacker rank invitation today. BTW what were the questions you got?
Taking the Palantir one tomorrow. Any advice? 60 minute time limit seems pretty tight if there are multiple questions 
Did you have to pass all test cases to get to the next round?
Not the same guy, but I also got the challenge and I applied on Aug 13th.
7th
Would you know if the SE intern position in NY office starts in summer or in January? Or can they just change the timeline depeding on situations?
Tbh I had difficulty with my profile for like a week and then one day it worked. Idk guy lol
Are you Canadian? I think they're not hiring Canadians for US positions this year. So that's probably why you got rejected.
Malvern, Pennsylvania
How long did it take to get an on-site?
[deleted]
[deleted]
What's in the survey? Do you have to write code?
[deleted]
A referral in-company? I wasn't aware (or at least was told by a direct family member - albeit one in their legal team) that they didn't do those.
Did you proceed to the next stage?
Haven't heard back yet either.

EDIT: just got my email to setup phone interview
Applied 2 weeks ago, got an email scheduling a call a week ago
[deleted]
Ya move on?
damn that sucks. Was that after the HireVue round for the 2019 Software Engineering Program?
How hard would you say the three phone calls were? I'm cramming like crazy right now.
How soon did you hear back that you had to do a third? I know the timelines are probably different from winter vs. summer, but from friends at Google everyone says it's best to not hear anything back, so I was just curious.
The first day it opened. Sept. 17th, I think?
I'll make sure to keep my eye out. xD
Yup, asked about location/project preferences.
Oops, you're right
I believe their cut off is actually 3.0. 3.5 is just preferred. I interned this summer and didn't have a 3.5 when I applied. 
pretty excessive, 2 hour interviews back to back (one technical, one behavioral), a round table discussion with other interviewers and then they go over how great the company is. My suggestion is to go on glassdoor and look up the Java developer interview questions cuz they asked me a lot of those and also to prepare heavy for the behavioral because that is really all they care about
The first step is a phone screening where they ask basic java questions and see if you could be a good fit. They care a lot about you being a leader than your technical skills. After that 30 minute phone screening I immediately got invited to an onsite interview (my other friend has still not heard back). For the onsite they booked a hotel room for me the night before and paid for travel expenses I only live an hour from the malvern office, but another candidate I talked to flew all the way from cali and they paid for most of it. My friend who worked there this summer made 28/hour and they paid for her to live at Villanova for free since she was 50 miles out. Although I liked the place and am very disappointed I didnt get an offer Vanguard is like a damn cult so thats the only thing I hated about it 
I have the same! behavioural questions + short puzzle. Actually I still haven't feedback from them. It's been 3 weeks since the interview
yea delaware 
Last year they spread out events throughout sept and oct, and seemed to send out invites 2-3 weeks before each event. As in, if the event you’re interested in is in late October you won’t hear from them until October. 
What did you work on during the hackathon also what level of programming did you have if you don't mind me asking?

you mind if I pm you asking some questions about the event?
:(
Interesting. I've applied twice before and was just ghosted without a straight up rejection.
For a summer position?
To be fair, I've interned there before so I got to skip the phone interview before.

If you pass the phone interview, which involves coding in a shared environment, you will  get an onsite invite.
About 2 weeks 
Yup, decided to post it anyways. Heres one for undergrads:

[Summer 2019 IT Intern](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/801566635/)
What is the step after the initial phone screen? Do you have another phone interview? On sites? I have been getting conflicting information from Glassdoor, Reddit, etc.
i guess its relative. its easy compared to the big tech companies but harder than other companies like vanguard or jpm
Yeah I passed Palantir's HackerRank but couldn't figure out the first question on the Goldman one. It should've been easy, but I couldn't get the formatting right. 
I just did it today. I didn’t think it was hard at all, and certainly not hard compared to Two Sigma, Palantir, Citadel, etc. who had brutal hackerrank this year.

In fact, 3 of the questions could all be solved with recursive backtracking.

The time limit definitely was tight though.
How long did it take for you to receive the hackerrank after applying to Atlassian?
Is it connected to leetcode?
Really? How did you learn that? I also applied and got a rejection, but it did not mention visa thing in the response nor in the posting. Wish they could write just one sentence about it so that we do not waste our time applying.
Uh oh
Same thing 
Well I didn't even get anything about a first round interview lol
Have you tried emailing your recruiter? also, what did they ask during the interview? did they ask any technical questions during the interview? I have my interview tomorrow and I am freaking out
You have to attend university in North America but can be an international student 
Got that Lyft offer, pm me :)
Applied in August. Just heard back now.
It was honestly pretty hard for me. 60 minutes for 1 question and I didn't work out a solution in time.
I am pretty new here so I am pretty confused what big 4's mean or big N's could you tell me what they stand for?
When did you apply? Its been two weeks for me and I haven't heard back for the swe dev position
Haven't heard back. You? 
August 26
[deleted]
Shit
I applied Lyft, Airbnb, and bloomberg but didnt get back anything yet... Is that a good sign? or bad sign? I applied very long time ago. like 4 weeks.

&#x200B;

I got rejected from Facebook, Palantir, RiotGames, Stripe, Reddit.

I have planned phone interviews with Google.

&#x200B;
You heard back from Twitter too? When did you apply?
It’s tomorrow :)
does facebook allows this? I applied to a diff posting online and my friend referred me for another posting though. I got the default mail from fb also about being referred.
I did the hirevue for JPM about 1-2 weeks ago, haven't heard back since.
Got the same response. Probably not going to attend (seems like a waste of time, although travel accommodations are paid for):
what location are you going to?
I just applied to their website on the 16th got accepted on the 9th of September for the plano location 
No. JPM invite people to code for good for multiple reasons. But, if your interview wasn't the best, but they feel you have potential then you'll get invite to Code for good! During that process, they judge how you deal with working with teams, your problem solving skills, and your leadership skills. 
Oct 19th
sad :(
These requirements are never really "requirements." It's generally what they're looking for but they will take sophomores given the right circumstances.
i got the snapshot + survey today
Mind if I pm u?
yes that’s what I mean 
I forgot where I read it but apparently Verizon doesn’t respond back until around that time. It was somewhere on reddit from previous intern experiences. 
SF (Slack), Seattle (Msoft)
Yeah mine is next Wednesday at that office as well. And same! It seems very last minute but hopefully it's a fun experience
That's rough :( hopefully someone replies you!
That's the first questionnnaire. There's a second one after the coding sample. 
yeah like after i did snapshot survey and the coding challenge I got an email back with another questionnaire
It's the same as stripes.
thanks! I think its always worth a shot. how would you recommend getting recruiters attention for interviews? should I cold contact recruiters for google for example? 
[deleted]
Lol
Yea i was referred and didnt get a hackerrank either
Two weeks ago
and on what date did you applied to their careers site?
Actually this contradicts your laziness.
Woo, at least it's easy! and damn, wish me luck with Akuna!

Thank you by the way!
Twitter was easy up until #3 lol I had no idea how to solve each case :/
I took their test and its been >1 week. havent heard back either.
Different person but got the hirevue about 2 weeks ago and an e-mail just now about phone interview or a hackathon of some sort
Was it a 30 minute on-campus screening? How was it?
About a month
[deleted]
Like Leetcode mediums? easys? hards? Are there any particular topics I should prepare for? I'm not really confident in technical interviewing :(
Does pass mean 100% on hackerrank?
Does pass mean 100% on hackerrank?
It also mentioned digital interview (record responses), that seems extremely lame.
Damn, didn't hear back for Slack. :(
Ditto, they sent an invite about a couple of days after applying
Same here, it looks like they do it in batches
When applying to offshore positions, do you fill the voluntary identification form? About the Race and Gender? I think that creates a bias towards Indians or Asians in general
Well I got the hirevue
What languages are available?
One of those was a med on LC lol, but still easy yeah
It's not - I left that field blank and still heard back from Twilio.
Leetcode-easy easy? What kind of topic
Yap, was very easy.
No DP. There were two questions and the second one built on the first one. In between questions we worked to optimize the code a bit. Nothing too difficult however.
Would you know if the SE intern position in NY office starts in summer or in January? Or can they just change the timeline depeding on situations?
Well, it's been a month so bye bye Twitter
It's okay!! All in due time yknow
same
First round
Last year they sent a mass email in like April saying they filled up all the spots for the year.  I remember doing the HackerRank the same day that I received it.

I read a ton of stories of people getting offers last year without even doing it, so I just ignored the HackerRank email this year.

Sure. When I talked to the recruiter on the phone she said it would be a coding question, systems design question, and general culture fit and teamwork questions. This was for a backend intern role, I think it’s slightly different for front end 
When is your interview? 

Edit: lol looked at your post history we go to the same school 
[deleted]
It’s basically hackerrank/leetcode 
How was the phone interview with Bloomberg?
update: I just got an email for superday
I got an email saying they updated my status in the portal so that's how I knew
[deleted]
[deleted]
[deleted]
Anything to look out for with the challenge? Bout to start
WTF Really? I solved 3 and didnt get anything back yet. How long did it take to get back?
It was internship
I still haven't heard from them. Did you get an offer?  They replied that it can take 3 weeks but it has been over 3.5 week. I am not sure what the delay means? Am I rejected or still in consideration?

&#x200B;
I hope so. Did you solve all questions? I am also wondering since it is google, you cannot tell anything.
Still no reply.
what about facebook also?
You got referred after you applied?
yes I did the JavaScript one for Akuna and I just pressed X after reading it. 
Did you do the Akuna Python one? How did it go?
Thank you for the encouragement!
That sounds like a great idea. I'll look into some. Thanks!
Yeah, seemed like a crapshoot anyway.
Oh wow. Thanks for the encouragement!
Sept 17th or 18th, so basically when the app came out.
Probably because this thread is for Summer 2019 Internships, not about Winter 2019.
[deleted]
How long does it take to receive the hacker Rank?
But did they send any interviews in that cause i only heard of rejections
Fair, I thought this would be for help applying to internships, not just listing open ones. That's my fault.
oh damn, I could have sworn it said 2019 in the description. Think this might actually be their fall 2018 positing.
Ill remove it to follow the intention of the thread.
I got it a while ago but havent started because Im still studying DS/Algos. Is there a certain time I have to get it done by? Then again it is optional and Im trying to apply for Twitter Academy so idk.
Sorry to bother, but how do these "hackerrank" things work? You design a program in it and have one shot to get it right? Is it timed, depending on when you open it or is there just a set closing date for everyone?
Jobs also like to see progress so get your foot in the door dude
Has anyone heard back after their Hackerrank invite?
does Capital One usually take sophomores?
so you didn't have to do an onsite for barclays to get accepted? I'm guessing you weren't from NY then?
To provide another POV on vanguard,  I actually had my phone interview yesterday (without doing any coding challenge yet). My recruiter said there were issues sending them out and I still haven't gotten it.
Is coding challenge the same thing as HackerRank? Algorithmic problems?
Hey thanks! I got invited to the HireVue interview. Was the last round of video interviews at Barclays technical? How many hours/calls/what did it consist in/did you wear a suit?
I didn't have a cover letter but also haven't gotten a rejection email, so that can't be the only thing.
What does closing the tab do? Can they watch what you do in real time?
I just closed the browser. No not real time.
The Akuna online test (at least when I took it last year) is split up into two equal length parts, the first part is mental math, and there were lots of multiplication and division questions on that part. The numbers they use in the questions are pretty mixed, some have decimals, some are whole numbers, but I found that usually the numbers weren't that large, generally less than 100. The second part I found to be a lot more difficult. Basically they give you a sequence of letters and/or numbers and you have to find the pattern. I'm having a hard time finding examples but there generally were some patterns you could follow to figure out the answers.

To practice the first part, you could use this site http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/ which seems to be pretty good. The website http://www.tradertest.org used to have some really useful practice tests on it but it seems to be having issues and the tests as of writing no longer are on there. However, there is an app which seems to have them: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.milapnaik.tradermathtest or https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trader-math-test/id1122059357?mt=8

Also keep in mind that speed is the most important thing. You need to complete a LOT of questions to move forward in the interview process.
Thanks for the answer man, appreciate you.
How long did it take for them to get back to you after completing it? That last question :)))))))

I would say two easies and 1 hard
Lol the base case is graduating with a degree. 
can't find the link? do you have it?
the second question? I solved it in linear, how did you get it to constant time?
& they make you make a sample store / normally code more stuff otherwise
About 6 days after the hackerrank
Bro wtf are we doing looking at Big N companies? Porn is the future!
Do they actually hire interns or /s?
Mid August
Usually January to April.
Stripe, DRW & Facebook are at the technical phone interview stage.

Goldman, Riot Games, and a couple of the smaller HFT firms have sent rejections already haha
No this is Patrick
Yup. Unfortunately, I still haven’t heard anything back :(. Does Microsoft ghost people?
1 Week for Two Sigma, 2 weeks for Palantir, 1 day for Goldman (I think it's automated) and a couple days for Stripe. 
heard back 2 days ago to schedule on-site
In the same boat by the way. I've read around that it takes like 3-4 weeks after HireVue but maybe others can offer anecdotes.
two-three weeks ago
About a week ago
Yup
The first day apps opened
does pokemon go back during the hype count?
I tried again and it worked now. Thanks!
Did you do coding and math or just the coding one? 
i heard it was string manipulation and DP questions, is that true?
CS job application portal power ranking:

1. lever, greenhouse, or any that has the following: no need to create account, gleans information from resume cleanly, one page form at most

2. workday, or any that has the following: need to sign up for account, sometimes forms are clunky

3. anything else pretty much: doesn't pre-fill stuff from resume, oh-god-why-2000s-tier web pages, arcane password requirements
Yup there is a section dedicated to pure coding (one question they gave me 20 minutes, and another one 60 minutes) and then the other section is the webcam stuff for 2 respones(30 seconds to think , and you can give up to a three minute response)
They gave "custom" coins
I'll not sure if they hire freshman. It will probably be more difficult as a freshman. As far as the coding questions, there were a few simple ones on string and array manipulation, one about making change, and then a moderately challenging recursive question. The behavioral questions were all fairly standard. Why JP Morgan, etc. 
8/23, so 18 days now. I've read around on Glassdoor of it taking 3 weeks to a month for some to hear back, so hopefully not down and out. When did you take yours?
Yea it was. Its not something you can really prepare for. Just be ready to not be intimidated when you start because most of the technologies will be unfamiliar to you. I got like 95% of it done but I have a feeling they want are going to select for the people that go above and beyond since there are more problems in the app than those listed to solve.
I just got a mail that my application has been received. Nothing after that. Been a week
Oh haha I think as long as you apply by October you should be fine. But some companies recruit in spring semester as well. 
For anyone that is also taking the Palantir one... I actually found it way easier than the Two Sigma one, so YMMV
I applied on the 15th so I hope I get it soon!
Pretty sure it's summer only but I am by no means a definitive source on the matter.
yep I'm Canadian and I got rejected, even when last year I had an interview. It probably didn't help that I applied for a full time position in the first place by accident and got rejected (no shit lol). 
I am from Eastern Europe actually.
Fuck lol
where is the application link?
Is it on the 28th?  If so I'll see you there!!
After my phone interview I got asked to do an on site quite quickly and had dates to choose from 
Applied Monday, got challenge Wednesday. No referral
No referral. Applied on the day it opened.
No code in the survey. It just asks a bunch of workplace preference questions, and some things to get to know you better.
I applied online.
I don't know the specifics of how it worked, but a friend of mine said that she had filled out the referral form. I didn't really question it haha.
Yeah
Good luck!
They are supposed to let us know our decision by Oct 15 so we still have time. I think they are kind of busy rn cause they are running another recruiting session now so they have to deal with them as well as us those who applied in the first recruiting session (July-mid Sept)
Yeah I was invited to the superday but declined b/c I have other offers.
[deleted]
behavioral is my strength haha, thanks for the heads up!
They have a nonprofit more or less tell you what they need developed (in my case, a web app), and the best version developed wins. I only had about an AP CS level of knowledge, I had not yet taken data structures. 
Sure! 
I applied through a referral though.
Wait you have to interview again even if you interned there? Is there a process to get a return offer?
Thanks, that makes sense. How did your interviews go? My phone interview went well, so I have my on-sites scheduled for next week. 
As far as I know, it can vary based on the team. Most Big N will have 1-2 more technical phone calls and then proceed to an onsite where you can expect to have around 3-5 interviews.
After my initial phone screen, which was just a behavioral interview where we only went over my stuff on my resume, I'll be doing my final rounds onsite. I did hear different stories of people having to do more in the phone interviews and more phone interviews in general so YMMV. Good luck though!
Personally, I found Google's to be much easier, as well as all of the ones I've taken for prop trading firms.
I found Two Sigma easy...

To each their own I suppose
I got mine about three days later (applied on Monday or Tuesday and got the invitation on Friday). Failed miserably - believe everyone who says it's hard.
contacted recruiter via LinkedIn. she mentioned that to me in her reply.
[deleted]
Yeah I emailed the recruiter but I haven't gotten a response yet. I finished the first round and they asked me some design questions. Like design a multimedia cookbook, organize a line, etc. They also asked some questions about my interest in technology and stuff about my resume. 
How long did it take to get the response after the final round?
[deleted]
I applied August 
not yet
About one hour
Stripe rejected you after hackerrank or before?
Is Code for Good meant to be a replacement for the normal interview process? I'm not sure if I interpreted the e-mail correctly.

Edit: e-mailed recruiter, you do one or the other
They have the best food at any hackathons I've ever been to lol. And I mean, I've attended 25+ hackathons. 

Plus, you have the chance to get an offer for an internship. 
This might be true for some. However, some companies have hard requirements. This is the case for Reddit.


They emphasized this in their Q&A.

Go ahead 
Ah, ok, cool. I did mine about a week and a half ago and never got a response. Maybe try emailing your recruiter?
I just got a Verizon video interview, any tips? Or types of questions that they ask?


my friend had offers from msft, salesforce (returning), and slack and he ended up choosing slack for what it's worth
I would personally go with the city I haven't done a previous internship at before to broaden my horizons, as SF and Seattle differ quite a bit.
I got both and this is their first response. Any input or thoughts on the coding challenge? Unfair like Peloton or easy leetcode type? 
[deleted]
lol bro I took it couple of days ago and yea it wasn’t that bad.  I had mine O(n) but space complexity was O(n) as well and now that I think about it, it could’ve been O(1).  Do you think I have any chance?
Follow them to their hotel after the career fair. 

Just kidding haha. Idk usually I apply online and if I'm lucky ill get an email back a few days to a few weeks later. For the most part that's how everyone gets something, unless you know someone at the company who can refer you. I've heard their referral program is great at FAANG
Oh thats cool.

Mid August
Yea we probably got ripd. I passed all test cases but I think my solution wasnt great 
Yes, the interviewer asked about my resume for 15 minutes and then gave me a Leetcode Easy problem for 15 minutes.
I finished with around 15 minutes to spare and cleaned things up a bit after.
the only way to become confident in technical interviewing is either a lot of practice or fuck up a couple of interviews :). 
Easy to medium. 
[deleted]
Yeah I'm curious about this as well
Neither did I :/
Yes, I filled that. that is only a survey and does not get attached to your application.
For JPMorgan all of the languages that are usually present were there.  The only company I've seen that had weird language limitations was Vanguard (Only Java or something for the 3rd question).
Thanks so much! 
In the summer only. They don't do off season internships.
Twitter is different. They'll email you in about 6 months to let you know that they're finished hiring for the year.
This
Got it. My first round question was rather easy. That being said, my interviewer wanted me to come up with different ways of doing the problem and analyzing the tradeoffs between each solution. Make sure you have a solid grasp of time and space complexity. My interviewer was constantly asking about that
Yea I told her I wanted to do backend so my onsite is for backend summer intern. Currently hubspot is my #1 choice so kinda sick if we end up meeting each other in real life lol. I saw on glassdoor that the system design question is often "URL Shortening" so practice that.
[Here's a list](http://callacarter.com/csfrosh/).

There are other ones too, you can google around.

I would prioritize going to career fairs and all women's hackathons, though. Those are better ways of applying to these programs than just applying online.
The interviewer went over my resume in depth, then I was asked 3 questions. 1 easy, 2 medium including a simple DP question.
Nice congrats!
SHIT.. Maybe I didnt get anything back because I got rejected.

So sad and depressing. What did you apply for? like which team did you choose?
Hm a week or so. It was "you passed, so apply for code for good event! If you can't make it we'll run you through the traditional interview!!"

I didn't want to spend 24 hours coding which is like a 3 day obligation for travel, lack of sleep etc. So I said no, I have other obligations at the moment and can't attend. I would like to move forward with the traditional interview process

Well now I feel like they're ghosting me. I followed up with them after not hearing back for like 10 days and they said "sorry I thought I emailed you, we'll get back to you with your phone interview schedule.

It's been over 10 business days now and I haven't heard back again.

I don't expect much beacuse ITT someone won the code for good hackathon and got rejected from JP Morgan. So yeah... it's off putting and I'm not even sure I'd want to work there anymore
At my school, and I applied for NYC I think
How did it go? I haven’t opened mine yet. 
Yea I was surprised tbh. I write clean modular code so maybe that was it or luck. I think it took 1-2 weeks
Okay. I can't speak to the hackerrank but I can tell you that the phone screen wasn't that difficult. And despite what others have said it was somewhat like Leetcode questions. I didn't solve it fully yet still passed somehow. Good luck!
no idea
i submit my app on their portal and then sent my resume to my friends who referred me so yeah 
/r/me_irl
Mine was C++ instead of Python and didn't do it yesterday lol currently very busy with school
This is absolutely what you should be doing. Even if they’re not necessarily tech focused, big names help. I interned at a Fortune 100 consumer goods company last year and have definitely been getting more interviews now. My friends that worked at similarly large companies in sectors such as defense have been getting even more.
There are companies that hire freshmen with no internship experience all the time. I even know of a company that hires kids in high school. I certainly don't think you should have trouble finding something with your status in school, though of course it's difficult to say without knowing the rest of your application.
I've heard of like two people who got positive responses
Just go ahead and start it. You’ll never truly feel like you’re ready so I’d say just go ahead and give it a crack. Yeah they say it’s optional but I would have to think that it helps
Nope, no on-site. I'm not from NY.
I used coding challenge for anything that wasn't a HackerRank. Some of them were take home assignments, but most were similar to HackerRank but just on a different website. 
The last round for me was two 45 minute video interviews. The first was technical (no coding, but they asked me lots of CS questions, many of which I didn't know; they also talk about the code you submitted during the HireVue portion). The next interview is like a situational/case interview. I wasn't expecting this, but it wasn't super challenging. It was basically like "so you're the project lead when these things go wrong, how do you respond?" Just articulate your thoughts well and you should be okay. I've heard of people having different types of interviews for the last round though, so it could be variable. Good luck! 
I just quit the hackerrank because I couldnt import the library for some fuckin reaosn
What kind of a score on the arithmetic zemtec thing should one aim for in 2 minutes standard settings?
Took it on a Saturday and heard back to schedule a phone interview the next Friday.
It might have been, I don't remember too well.
They definitely do. It doesn't seem like applications are out yet, but trust me this is the first place I'll mention it to when they come out.
I was ghosted last year with no reply even after a month. after applying online how much time did they took to get back to you?
Have you heard back from Palantir? Passed their coding challenge 3 weeks ago and haven’t heard anything so far :/
When did you finish HireVue?
When is/was your onsite for GS? I have one coming up and I wanted to see if there were anyone that already went through the onsite for the 2019 internship and can share their experience.
Good luck! :)
Probably not? I was talking with a Riot Games recruiter who emailed me and she asked me if I played any games, I said occasional Mario Kart/Smash Bros with friends and she said they wanted people who are more "into" gaming (which is fair enough).
If I just started practicing 2 weeks ago for interviews, is it better if I wait until the end of summer to apply? Or wait until campus career fairs?
You must have an insider :) Can neither confirm nor deny though :)

God why can't everything use greenhouse.........
Can you check Pm please
Your JPM coding challenge had 3 questions? Mine only had 2. I wonder why?
Yeah, I took mine on 8/24. Good luck!
Cool, thanks! Could you use any language or..?
How many questions for palantir for 60 minutes?
Good luck!
Ok well, there's your reason. I think you gotta wait for the European posting.
Sept. 28th and Oct. 5th were given as options. Most likely will take the second but I'm still looking at my schedule to make sure there is no conflict. 
 after the hackerrank, when did you get a phone interview? I finished mine a few weeks back and haven’t heard anything.
Yeah just took it. Wish I answered some of those differently in hindsight but oh well.
[deleted]
Congrats. I'm guessing it's a phone interview?
Thanks! 
oh, well grats anyways lol
You should probably hear back soon. Their response to me was within a business day or two.
Have you applied for internship or full time?
I interned there two years ago and I rejected the return offer. Now, I want to go back but they want me to redo the onsite. I got to skip the phone screen.
Hey, I have my Bloomberg onsite coming up and I wanted know how yours went and if you had any tips?
how long did it take them to get back to you after your phone screen?
Really? What trading firms?
Ok same, good to hear :)
how much time between first round and applying?
1 week, how's your interview?
Oh! thanks alot do you happen to have a list of those big N's who offer sponsership?
Oops I meant when was your phone screen 
after hackerrank. I passed all tests but still.. rejected
Yes.
Almost every time I've seen "we're currently looking for a junior or senior" it has never been a *hard* requirement. That comment doesn't seem any different to me. The only place I know where it is a proper requirement are NSA contracting jobs because Top Secret clearance can take up to a year, and would expect you to come work full time after you graduate.
I just got a Verizon video interview, any tips? Or types of questions that they ask?


Hm so you got two questionnaires?

And the coding sample was easier than leet easy but some got different questions. 
Did it over the weekend so I got it on like the next business day (Monday)
Cool, thank you!
Do they have tests for you to check that it works? Are there any particular topics you’d recommend I study? I suck at stuff like Trees/Graphs which is why I’m concerned.
have you heard back with next steps?
Looks like it's a ghosting for us fellas... wack
Ohh, okay!
Good looks dude 
Did you get some sort of an acknowledgement mail about the referral for uber ? 
Thank you! Do you remember how long it took uber to reach out after your referral?
And when did they get these...that means positives HAVe gone out...
Oh ok. Is the Barclays untimed assessment the behavioral thing you were talking about? Do they send it out to everyone?
Thanks! Did you wear a suit for the video/HireVue interviews? Did the CS coding questions lean towards algorithms and data structures, system design or programming? Do they ask about agile methodologies? Was the HireVue coding portion similar to HackerRank style of questions (they let you choose your favorite programming language)?. Thank you, I really appreciate it. 
I honestly have no idea. The Akuna test is 22 minutes long, 11 minutes per section. It's not clear how many questions you should be able to complete to move forward either.
Just figured out #3 i think. Rip.
Took like two weeks to schedule an interview. Unfortunately, it was extremely difficult to understand my interviewer.
Yeah I heard back like a day or 2 later with a rejection, "No open positions that match my skillset".
yea i'm curious about this also, when did you finish the HirVue and when is your on-site?
Haven't done it yet because some school stuff popped up, and I got an offer from Capital One, so I'm probably going to sign with them.
I would just apply now. I’ve had trouble getting interviews through online applications until this year, where the difference being I’ve applied for companies literally the day the applications come out. I think the fact that they’re rolling admission really plays a big factor in getting an interview. That’s just my two cents though.
I may be remembering incorrectly; I've taken a lot of coding challenges recently, lol. 
Same to you :)
when did you guys took your hackerrank?
Nope you have to use what they give you and you probably dont (maybe) have experience using it.
Thanks for the relief. I really hope that's the reason, because sometimes I dont even feel like applying anywhere anymore.
Not the other guy you were responding to, but I was invited to a phone interview with Vanguard before completing the HackerRank.
So I actually went to one of their IT Explore days and got a call shortly after. Going to one of those is the best way to get a recruiter on ur ass quickly 
What exactly though? Anything that I should think carefully about before submitting?
17th sept. 
Probably, she set me up with a technical recruiter on Friday who hasn't emailed me yet.
internship
Like a week, from what I remember. I kind of forgot about it and then received the email for the next steps. 
Optiver, IMC, Akuna, Virtu, Citadel (I know Citadel is technically a HF, but it's similar enough that I classify it with the others)
I applied late August and got an email to schedule an interview the next day. 
I think it went ok, I had it this week so I guess I’ll keep waiting
Hey, Unchart3disOP, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Almost 2 weeks ago
how long after you completed?
Yea there are 3 test cases that you see the input and like 15 hidden test cases for each problem. Mine was basically constructing a ghetto-ass soduko divided in 5 problems. problem 1 was like building the soduko, problem 2 was something similar, problem 3 was checking for a winner i think, problem 4-5 were creating a rough solver for the soduko
[deleted]
I've been ghosted by so companies so far... very wack :(
Nah a recruiter emailed me with details for setting up interview
I emailed the recruiter saying I had an offer due in a month and she got back to me in < 3 days 
Yeah, I think so. It was a generic behavioral thing, I think they give it to everyone, but I'm not sure. 
I did wear a suit. The CS questions were literally about everything. My interviewer just had pages of questions on everything from operating systems and networks (of which I had no knowledge) to data structures. I can't remember if I was asked about agile. Oh, I was also asked about Barclays values at the end, so I would at least know what they are. 

If I remember correctly, you can use any programming language. Most of the questions are pretty straightforward, I think there was maybe one or two that I found pretty challenging. 
I’m pretty sure mine was 7 min arithmetic, 15 min sequences. I passed with about 40-50 on arithmetic and ~15-20 on sequences, if I remember correctly.
I'm struggling a lot with the TraderMathTest app. One of the questions is: 35.676 + .0046 * 5971 - 7.047. Am I suppose to be able to do something like this in my head quickly? This would probably take me around a minute and would be lucky not to make a mistake. 
I gotchu. Can’t tell if the lack of response is a good or bad thing 
Have anyone got interview at Microsoft this time by applying online to their software engineer intern opening?
Completed it on 8/19
I got 4/5 of the challenges and it took me longer cause I don't use the language given and I got rejected. :(
Gotcha, thanks so much!! 
I rushed because I thought it was timed. It's just some easy behavioral questions but a couple of them weren't clear for me
Either way, best of luck!
Of those I have only done the Akuna hackerrank so far but it was much harder than goldman. hm, guess I will try the others. Thanks a lot man 
Was it an onsite or just a video call? Feel free to PM me.

^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37)
I ran out of time for the last problem. Did you solve all the problems/do you know if solving all the problems is necessary to move on usually (for Riot or for other companies)?
Someone on VISA looked at my application though, I got a notification.
can u let me know if you hear back?
How long afterwards did you hear back?
What was your next step in the process. I think I did about the same as you, although I might've gotten a few less on the sequences. I didn't want to skip any and got stumped on around number 10-12
I'm not sure if they would put something that complicated, they usually only do one operation per question. 
The trick to these types of questions is to rework the numbers into something that’s trivial to calculate.

For example, if you get 47^2, then you know that it’s equal to (40+7)^2 = 1600 + 2 * 280 + 49 which is trivial to do in your head. Another one would be multiplying 46 * -0.08.

46 * -0.08 = (40+6)*8 / -100 =(320 + 48) / -100 which is easy to do in your head.

Its all about practice and finding the right simplification for your brain to handle the problem in a timely manner
Well I haven't been outright rejected yet so there is hope for me yet! Good luck on your other ventures
Interesting, did they really reject you or you assume that you are rejected because of the 4/5? As I completed it couple weeks ago with 5/5 still haven't heard back anything
You too 
Onsite 
I got 100% on the first 4 problems and 50% on the last problem and I moved on. 
can u let me know if you hear back?
?
Have you heard back from them after that? I got the notification a while ago but so far nothing.
[deleted]
I believe it took about a week to go from the behavioral questions to the HireVue, and then almost two weeks between the HireVue and the final round interview. 
If you made it to the first round, you're also guaranteed to get a personality test. I got mine emailed the next day. If you pass both of those, then you will get invited to do a one-sided, 5 minute interview where some questions will pop up on screen and you have to record yourself answering them. You don't have time to prepare for them, but it's not that bad. There is one behavioral question, a few quick mental math arithmetic questions, a mental math word problem, and a pen and paper probability problem. After that is a technical phone interview with more math questions. If you make it past that, it's a final web interview, though I haven't gotten to that stage yet.
Yeah, I got that. And 47 squares would be easier to calculate with by saying (50-3)\^2 = 2500 - 50 \* 6 + 9 = 2500 - 300 + 9 = 2209. I can do basic two digit by two digit calculations under 6 seconds, just not 3 digit by 3 digit.
I got an email.
Oh my last problem I just didnt have enough time to get to. Its not blank but im pretty sure it doesn’t compile.
How long did it take for you to receive a response from Riot after the hackerrank?
Nope. Still waiting.
thanks
Ok, thank you.
Is this for the quant-trading position? I passed the math test, but they sent me a Python coding  challenge for the next round. I applied for the swe position and got wrecked by the coding challenge in C++, i'm hoping this one will be easier.

Edit: It appears I applied for Quantitative Trader and not Trader. Looks like I gotta learn Python :)
oh i dont know then :(
about a week
This was for the regular trading position. However, I applied to all three of trading, quant trading, and quant development and I only had to do one math test and coding challenge. I guess it double counted for the overlapping positions. I have not had my phone interview for quant dev or quant trading yet.
I just got the python challenge too, I have until sep 4th to do it. How was it for you?
Haven’t done it. Was gonna put it off for a while as Python isn’t my best language
Same here, I only know c/c++ so I'm looking over some Python rn
